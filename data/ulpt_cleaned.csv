15, request: where to sell railroad debris for scra,"i go on long walks a lot near train tracks (yes, i am keeping safe. do not worry about my chances of getting hit by a train, etc.) and for years i’ve noticed that our local stretch of tracks has iron spikes strewn off to the side for miles. not part of the tracks anymore or anything, just lying there everywhere at the bottom of the rock slopes as trash. iron slag is also abundant there in the same way. 

i know it will take quite a bit to be worth much selling these for their scrap value, but either way, still seems like free cash to me. the problem is, though, from what i’ve heard it’s illegal to sell any part of a railroad. even if it’s no longer *part of the railroad*. and that many places buying scrap metal will either turn you away or turn you in for trying to sell it to them. 

so with that in mind, any tips for finding the “right” kind of people to take these to? tbh i’d be doing the city a favor by picking up trash they don’t bother do deal with themselves.",UnethicalLifeProTips

arlines allow only one rollaboard/carry-on plus ""a personal item like a purse or laptop bag."" however if you also have a cpap (night time breathing machine), which come with their own soft-sided cases, you can bring that too, without penalty, because it's a medical device. you can fit a lot into a cpap carry-on -- especially if you don't have a cpap inside.

you can find cpap carrying cases, usually the size of small toaster oven, for about $25-$35 on amazon.  get yourself an older, ugly version, a grey/ black one with a long shoulder strap, not the new nifty ones that look like expensive backpacks or cross-body bags, to avoid questions from the start.

in 5 years of bringing my cpap in said ugly bag, airline staff (tsa checkers or when boarding) don't even blink, they are accustomed to spotting them as you come to the gate with a rollaboard, an obvious cpap bag hanging off it, and a laptop bag or purse. at the most they may say ""cpap?"" as they look at the bag and you just say yep and they wave you through.

68,: get a great deal on a house by having your friends go to the neighborhood being really ghetto and trashy.,"so decades ago my wife and i bought our house we were trying to buy a home in a really desired area. a friend at the time told me how he got 7 percent of the asking price for his house by having friends and family go to the area being really trashy people.

apparently, people won't even want to look in that neighborhood if they think that there is a chance that you can be their neighbor.

open beer cans, public displays of affection driving shitty cars the list goes on.  we scared all the buyers from that open house. in 2 months they dropped the asking price by 5 percent. we offered 9 percent lower and they took the deal. just in a flash all the ghetto and trashy behavior went away.

something that is funny my nephew did the same thing when he bought his home a few years back.  it's a sucky thing to do but you save up to 10 percent on your home purchase.",UnethicalLifeProTips

this did two things, i seen he posted a selfie in an amsterdam coffee shop which definitely humanised him a lot for me, and i also discovered he’s really interested in cryptocurrency, which gave me something to talk about in the interview (not blatantly obvious) and i could tell he was eating it up.

77,: a great way to f*ck with people you don’t like,"if you’re in a social gathering and there’s a person or more than one people you dislike, always be the guy who’s willing to take the group photograph and do it with your own phone. when you’re back home, fuck with their faces in photoshop, but very slightly. this is important because you wouldn’t want to make it too obvious. make their teeth slightly more yellow, make their forehead slightly bigger, make their eyes slightly smaller. you’ll be treading on a fine line between [obviously shopped] and [not uglier at all]. a great way to see if you did a good job is to compare the original photo to the shopped one when you’re done and do some fine tuning accordingly afterwards. be very careful not to leave any artifacts or mistakes on the photo.

i’ve been having so much fucking fun doing this for the last 3 years and i highly recommend it. i rarely get involved with people i dislike if i’m hanging out but the office parties on the other hand become a blast. i’m usually having more fun at the party thinking about which part of my boss’ face or body should i slightly modify after the party than actually being involved in it.

side story: there was this one time we were forced to go to an agile summit as the whole development team and i fucking hated the whole experience and mostly everyone i’ve met during the event because of their fakeness and their ladderclimbing, white collar networking attitude. so i acted super friendly towards everyone and took photos with a shit ton of people and dedicated 2 whole days to fuck with most of their faces. when i was done, i sent them to the organization’s linkedin account and they actually got published to be seen by hundreds of people. there were some suspicions among the dms i’ve received afterwards which i completely ignored; but in general, people seemed to buy it.

82," request - relocating to another office within my company because my wife is ""being relocated""","apologies for what i'm sure is about to be a wall of text incoming. here's the skinny:

my wife and i have decided that we don't want to live in our current city/state anymore and have chosen denver as our desired destination. my company has an office in denver, but it's a small office that has &lt;20 people, whereas my current office is our second largest office. my wife already works from home and would have no problems continuing on with her company in the event that we were to move. she has gotten the green light from her boss to move anywhere on the planet with an internet connection so no worries there.

i have casually brought up the idea of transferring to our denver office with my boss in the past and have been told in no uncertain terms that we have no intention of moving anyone from it (my department) to denver. here's where the unethical bit comes in.

if i were to tell my company that my wife's job was relocating her to denver, but i'd like to stay on with the company and work from our denver office i think i'd have a better chance of making this move work and keeping my job (which i love, for the record). while it would be great for the company to cover relocation expenses, i'm fine to pay for those out of pocket so long as i have a job after moving.

the real question is: **is there any proof that my company might request in terms of my wife being relocated instead of opting to move on her own?** i obviously don't want to get fired after moving if my company were to find out we moved of our own accord vs ""being relocated""

considerations: i spoke to my boss about this in early july 2020 and moving to denver came up naturally in the conversation. we talked about it very briefly and very high level so i doubt he remembers. on top of that, my wife and i won't be ready to make the move until fall 2021 so i am not worried about him thinking i'm trying to pull a fast one on him when we do make the move. he and the rest of my team (except one other person) are already in another state from my office so i'm not concerned about my day-to-day being different. we've also been working from home during covid which i think is further proof that we don't need to be in the same office as each other to get work done.

any other holes you can poke in my plan are greatly appreciated as we'd like to have a firm handle on how things will go before we sell our home and start making arrangements to relocate. thanks!",UnethicalLifeProTips

one of the professors got a phd from a big university, but i have to pay $45 to get an electronic copy of it. the other one got a questionable phd from the chicago school professional psychology, which seems to be a for profit university that doesn’t make their students’ dissertations readily available.

quick backstory: i have 9 gcses a*-c (i'm old) and want to take classes from this online college and study maths again, for equally questionable reasons. i don't need to, i just want to, so no need to explain why it's pointless.

college says gcses are free unless you got a c or higher. otherwise pay £800 or something.

i do not want to pay £800. i just want the free education.

does anyone know if they actually check? if so, through what means? would they ask for the school i attended? if so, could i lie and say i was home-schooled?

not sure if this will help, but my legal first name and surname are entirely different to the name i was born with so if they checked some kind of record, the name wouldn't be on there.

if i try my luck, how likely am i to get caught?
if they wouldn't let me in for free, i'd just pay the £800 but i assume at that point they wouldnt want me on the course because then they'd know i'm a dick who tried to cheat the system and such. so if the risk is too high, i'll just pay the fee.

order the exact same product from amazon. if you've previously ordered it, i would recommend using a different address and/or account so it doesn't seem suspicious. once you receive it, claim you have a fault with the product and need to return it; the product didn't work out of the box.

amazon will then accept either an immediate refund, or you may need to return the product. if you need to return it, simply switch out the new one for the old one. repackage it best you can, and then send it back. i've never had this fail because they don't match serial numbers or anything. plus, the item will stay out of circulation because you've already reported the item is faulty.

it wasn’t until yesterday that they finally finished it, and i wouldn’t be surprised that it was because i made an angry call. 

when i went to make a much needed trip to the grocery store, my scooter just randomly started giving out at traffic lights. mind you, this was in the dark, and i almost got hit by a car. they also didn’t lubricate the cable, which caused the throttle to get stuck (it wouldn’t let off by itself when i was stopped and my engine didn’t cut off) 

i’ve decided to do this myself this time even though i don’t know shit about scooters. i’m having to replace the new throttle (the casing was broken?) and adjust my idle. 

but anyways i lost my job because of how long they took to do a “one hour” job. i spent christmas alone at home because of it, and because of how it was fucked the same day nye as well. they were putting together stock for their store before doing that simple fix.

i bought a car a few years back and got an auto loan through my credit union and couldn't help but notice that the rate was spectacular - like 2% interest per year. compare that to a personal loan, the lowest i've seen is maybe 8-9% per year on one of those bad boys. i understand that it's because of the car being collateral.

the way it worked when i bought the car was that the credit union wrote a check to the car company, i gave the car company the check, i got the car, i paid off the loan.

if i were to, say, make a 72 hour return deal with the car dealer, could i somehow get cash back for the car? or would they just pay the credit union directly and the whole deal is a bust?

(woah! what a helpful guy) we quickly grabbed the umbrellas, thanked him for his empathy and left asap.

253, request: how to remove the company admin on my company macbook (i quit 4 months ago),"i quit my job back in august. at the time of leaving, hr said they would send me instructions on how to send back my company macbook to them. 

it's been nearly 4 months and i haven't heard anything from hr, so am assuming this has been forgotten about. i'm certainly not going to remind them that i still have it.

i'd like to gift the macbook to a family member and am wondering how can i fully cleanse the macbook of the company's presence / control? it appears that they still control some top level permissions on it, even if i'm also listed as an admin.

for example:

\- at the login page it says ""this laptop is owned by company. by logging in you adhere to our policies. if found, call this number"". - how can i remove that?

\- i'm unable to turn off the password requirement at the log in page (it's remains grayed out even with the lock opened).

\- when i open chrome's settings, it says ""your browser is managed by company"".

\- when i try to download os big sur it says it's ""currently blocked until company security evaluates it"".

if the company ever asks me to return it i would, but until then i'd rather someone gets some use out of it rather than it just gathering dust!",UnethicalLifeProTips

269,: doordash hack,"so on christmas night, my boyfriend and i were chilling in bed after a nice at-home spa day when we decided to order fried chicken. while we were looking for places that are open on uber eats and doordash, we had the idea to order the food and go pick it up ourselves (since my boyfriend was already registered on doordash as a dasher, we thought * heck, we’ll get paid for picking up our own order 💁🏻‍♀️*)

on our way out, i kept checking the order page to see if a dasher was assigned to my order but it was christmas and the chances of a dasher getting there before us was slim. my boyfriend wasn’t able to get assigned to the order either, but he knew that doordash only asks for a name when you pick up an order (other food delivery apps like uber eats and skipthedishes generate a code for each order that the merchant has to check with the driver). he was gonna go in and ask for a doordash order under the name we ordered it by to get the food. for precautions, i also took a screenshot of the order but without the order progress bar that shows your order getting sent out, prepared and picked up. you can just scroll up to hide the bar, hold and take a screenshot of just the order items. this will look like the drivers' screen on the app. 

i also thought if he picks up the order without getting assigned to it, we can call doordash after and claim food was never delivered to get a refund.

anyway, we find the place we ordered from and he goes in to get the food. i was just sitting in the car thinking he’s gonna come back empty-handed. there’s no way this is gonna be that easy. **but he came back with lots of foodies!**  the adrenaline rush was real tehe. 

we went home all happy and ready to munch down on some free fried chicken. i kept checking the app and there was still no dasher assigned to the order so a refund was coming our way. 
and then we see the name on the bag is not the name we ordered by!!!! it was the exact same order plus fried shrimp, and 2 very random drinks. so my order was probably still at the fried chicken place getting ready for pick up 👀 few minutes later i get a notification from doordash that a dasher picked up my order!! 
eeeep! shit just keeps getting more exciting! we ended up with 2 big orders and they also forgot to apply the promotion we had a for a chicken sandwich, so we contacted customer service and now we have a $14 doordash credit we can use for the next round 😁 

best christmas dinner ever! might as well make this a tradition 🎄

moral of the story, doordash needs a better system but until then use the hack at your risk. and make sure you do it at a less busy time, it worked for us because there weren't many drivers around at the time.

i have a kid, only one thankfully, but things aren't much easier with less kids. because of him i've stayed away from getting my hands too dirty (that coupled with i'm almost on my 5th year before getting my record expunged so that i might attempt to become a productive member of society once again \*yawn\*) but if i'm honest with myself? the main options for me will still be poultry warehouse, pork warehouse, tire warehouse or pharmaceutical -you guessed it- warehouse. or nursing... (i'm a firm believer in not doing something in that field if you know your heart's not going to be fully into it)

my parents don't live with me but my father is 75 with ms and now covid. he and my 62 year old mother are quarantined and also now solely rely on me for a while. my father admittedly isn't doing too well. i'm admitting that to you guys before i've really admitted it to myself, i guess... which domino effect means i've also lost my child care.

 i live in a section 8 housing and between roots growing through the plumbing of this old place and the stove shortages, i shower in moderations and eat a lot of cold cuts. 

right now i'm trying out a few cashback apps (for gas -referred by instacart called getup-side) and i was going to try to use gig wok to do cashback for grocery receipts but my car is slowly failing.  i get those free lunches from the schools due to the pandemic (i usually hit more than one to offer my son variety). i smoke pot so i sell a little to support the habit but its not legal in my state yet (it keeps me off anti-depressants and anxiety medz. i refuse to fall victim to those) 

but that's where i am so far... i have an education but with a violent record? \*raspberry noise\* so the absence of a decent job isn't from lack of effort. (did i mention that i have violent misdemeanor from a child custody case gone horrible? they're misdemeanors nonetheless which do not get businesses tax write-offs for hiring me like a felony would) 

other than to continue to destroy my car by driving an hour and a half just to deliver groceries and chick-fil-a to lofts and mansions... to hope that maybe at least one soul, 1 of the 1%.. the elite, the entitled... the privileged will at the most note my effort for punctuality and a positive attitude to tip more than $2.. 

basically i'm adaptable. i'm versatile . i'm a hustler! just lost in the sauce right now with no sense of direction

i would like to consider myself relatively intelligent and resourceful so i cant help but feel there has to be something else.  i honestly don't know what direction to start. why start hear? \*shrugs\* i'm getting older and the idea of continued micromanagement and physical labor isn't as appealing as when i graduated over 10 years ago. hence why i've chosen here to request ideas, guidance and knowledge.

she's rude, a micromanager, and makes us attend meetings for days then tells us that we need better time management skills when we worry about not making deadlines.

315, dd dasher and gh drivers. collect half pay christmas eve/day and ny eve/day. run bluestacks on windows 10. mock locate to closed restaurants.,"i run all my gig apps off bluestacks at my house. the apps do not know you are mocking because your mock location is the location when running off a computer. there are no wireless relays sending latlong or altitude. i typically can add $3-5 per dd delivery by mocking to a specific area by a freeway. i also know the latlong where doordash like to send requests for alcohol or grocery orders. none of the apps know you are mocking as all locations are wherever the mock is set up. i even run parsec in my car and will mock around town to spots that always pump out big orders from specific establishments. i've noticed the locations change throughout the day, but every location for that part of the day never fails to produce a similar lucrative outcome

enough of the rants. you can use this setup to mock next to well paying restaurants and other businesses that are closed for christmas and new years day. 
these are the apps
1. fake gps location professional: its a free app. it's very easy to use.
2. lockito: dd and gh with smell fishy business if there is no
gps history from where you accepted the order to when you arrived. if you get a well paying order that is not where you are currently mocking, use lockito to fake a ride to the location. this will cover your ass as you can show you ""drove"" there and they won't think anything of it.
3. bluestacks: download this on your windows 10 pc. this is how you'll install android apps to your computer. having a cpu that can handle a lot of processes is good to have. i have a 10600k 6 core 12 thread cpu and it can handle a lot of processes being open, but can still crash from an overload. its not the best and it can be better. now, something like a dell workstation would be killer to have for this setup. also, you can sideload an android os to your computer if you wanted and avoid bluestacks. you'll still need a decent cpu to handle the process.
4. if you want, download and run parsec. you can remote view your pc from an android phone. check youtube and reddit on how to srt it up. if you don't understand remote viewing your pc or cloud positive, this will blow you away. it does take up a lot of data, but there is the 1.1.1.1 warp vpn that seems to work very well with parsec. it has helped hide almost all of my data that is used when i run parsec. i'd recommend running it at 5 mbps for the bandwidth and nothing over 10 mbps is required to stream for this usage


well this is how you do it.

2. when offered, google if 
restaurant is open/closed
4. if closed, lockito drive
to restaurant
5. swipe arrive
6.take ss of closed store 
on google
7. select restaurant closed 
when prompted

refund was easier than ever and got a $10 gc bc the item was no longer available...

it looks just like a regular order..... 

they are suppose to say that theyve been refunded in ir orders... right??

also when it's really busy, and there's only one clerk at the kiosk which monitors the self checkout or nobody there at all.

when doing this, pick items that are small and easily concealable, like candy bars, 5 hour energy bottles, small tools, etc. anything that can fit inside the palm of your hand makes for easy pickens for this. also it helps if you are buying multiple of the same item and you scan one and grab two or more and put it into the shopping bag. don't overdo it, and you will have a good chance to pull it off seamlessly.

now here's the best part. if you get caught, or the shoplifter alarm goes off or w/e and they find you didn't pay for certain items, you can get away 100% scot-free by saying it was an accident, and you didn't mean to steal. then at that point you can give up the items you didn't pay for if you don't want to buy them or just pay for them. 

it gets better if they still accuse you of stealing, and if they keep the pressure on you, you can throw it back at them, make a scene, yell, and demand to talk to their manager. make a loud scene in front of everyone that they accused you of stealing when you forgot to scan an item on accident, and threaten to call their corporate headquarters for poor customer service and rudeness. 9 times out of 10, the manager will show up and try to bribe you, maybe a gift card, let you have the unpaid items, something for free so that you don't make them look bad.

for example, a few of you hang out after work, and maybe go for a drink. then, john makes a comment to his friends about how attractive sarah is. when you report this to hr, you don't need to mention that this was after work, or even that sarah wasn't there. you get to interpret and frame it your way within reason, and make john look like a predator. when witnesses start getting called to hr, hr will care about whether john made those comments over the actual context of the conversation. (see last paragraph for why this is). even if john does not get fired, he will be placed under heavy watch and be last in line for any promotion.

if you are a women, you can also get directly involved by claiming to be the victim. however, you shouldn't do this too often, because it will cause suspicion. all you need to do is get the guy in a room alone with you for a few minutes. this can actually be anywhere in the company, but a room works best. makes sure there are no cameras in that room, so it ends up being your word against his. after you are in the room with him for a few minutes, grab your stuff and scream before you run out the room. the noise will make people look your direction and remember, which will help your case later. a few hour later, go to hr and tell them that you want to ""switch departments"" or ""switch to a different shift"". when they ask why, then accuse the guy of sexual assault. it's better to wait for hr to ask why, rather than make the accusation directly, to cause less suspicion. after the guy is dealt with, you can then just change your mind about switching department/shift, and claim that you were emotionally distressed at the time.

here is why this works:

the hr department of a company will always work to protect the company and its interests. so, hr will always act most aggressive when there is a threat to the company. when the hr department hears the slightest rumor about sexual harassment, they will go on high alert mode. they will start weighing between firing the guy or risk a lawsuit by the woman. it's way cheaper for the company to fire the guy, than to risk a lawsuit. this is why you can always win with this.",UnethicalLifeProTips

438, may have found a glitch with h2o wireless. $20 for 2 months of unlimited talk/text and 5gb of data. only downside is you have to get a new number every 2 months. anyone thinking about a burner phone,"so at first i thought h2o wireless was trying to dick me around about some bonus points for referring a friend to the service.but now it's looking like maybe, just maybe, we were accidently logged in to his account when we generated the referral link and sent it to his email address, before he ever had a number with them.so, if that's possible, it means you can create an account, refer yourself, pay $20 for the first month of service &amp; sim card, and then use the bonus points you get for referring yourself to get a 2nd month of service for free.

439, - tired of your old car? cosplay as a valet and get a new car!,"of course, don't actually go to a company and apply to become a valet. then, they'll have your information and come after you. you don't need to be a valet, you just have to look like a valet. 

go to your nearest hotel, casino or other company that looks like they may have valet service.. but don't have valet service. then, get a nice valet outfit from a costume store or from another company for even more realism. make sure to stay clear from the line of sight of the information desk. those pesky customer service agents will ruin your plan. 

wait around for the car of your dreams to show up. ask if they have been here to this location before? very common question. if they say yes, tell them the garage is still open and have them go park their car. you don't want to be tied up with regulars. they may also come after you or ask further questions like ""oh i didn't know this place had valet, is this new?"" it's best to cut the conversation short and send them on their way.

now, if they answer ""no"". well, well. there's your ticket to a brand new car. tell them the valet rate is something believable but on the cheaper side. if they have a fancy car, they won't mind throwing a few bucks at valet. write down their information and tell them they don't have to pay now, they can pay later when they check-out. if you want a few bucks in addition to a new car, just take their money right then and there. and bingo, you have a new car. drive slowly to not garner attention but fast enough that when the information desk informs them that there in fact is not a valet service, you are long gone.",UnethicalLifeProTips

446,": if you need an ambulance, leave your wallet behind and give fake identity information to the emt. you'll never be billed for the ambulance ride.","emts really don't care. they just collect your billing/insurance information because they're told they have to. 

they cannot, by law, refuse you service because of insurance or ability to pay.

give them a fake name, address, birthday, ssn, and phone number. claim not to have your wallet on you or leave it behind. they can't force you to give it to them and they can't verify any of the information you give them in the ambulance.

tell them you're self-pay. that, or you can list a major insurance company as your provider and tell them you don't have your card on you and don't know your policy number. the emts don't actually process the billing and the billing department could normally look you up in the insurance system based on your social security number, name, and birthday. 

emts simply fill out the patient care report and upload it to the hospital system later, which the billing department draws from. 

once you're in the emergency room, you can give fake information again unless you're going to be admitted for a few days. in which case, they'll be able to see if your info checks out and discharge you if it doesn't. 

if you're just there for a few stitches, a shot of antibiotics, or other short-lived emergency, they won't deny treating you and they won't be able to send a bill to a fake name or address. 

for me, i have a fake name i use for things i don't want to give my real name for and even a practiced signature in that name. i also just change the last four digits of my social security number so it looks real on paper, and change just the month and day of my birthday.

do not fake your medical history or allergies. they won't be able to identify you through that but it could have disastrous consequences to your health if they don't know something about your body. such as an allergic reaction to penicillin.",UnethicalLifeProTips
447, - lesbian relationship issue - time to throw the low blow," 

by way of background, i was assigned male at birth, because apparently for some doctor the fact i had a 'penis' and had no 'vagina', gave him the right to label me a 'male', despite a complete lack of consultation with me. well admittedly, i cried loudly, which was probably my way of saying, 'i'm really a girl', but did they listen to my voice? no, silenced (metophorically, not literally, they didn't like put a pillow over my face or anything, it was a hospital not a home for unwed catholic pregnant women).

i am currently being seriously harrassed by some redditors who today followed me around reddit sending harrassing messages to me or mods. i wonder if covert transphobia is at work, and people have said the most abusive things to me, ""grow a pair"", ""incel"", mocking me for being ""a man and a woman"". but enough about me, let's get to the tip of the knob immediately.

so my girlfriend had my kid like nearly three years ago but she did not tell me at that time, she says she was scared of me. she is a bit messed up, she had some abuse experiences in childhood, although i suspect she is a good mother. anyway, she disclosed the kid more recently when i kept pinging her. the thing is, when we met, she used to shave her genitals, and i identified as a heterosexual man. she was quite an aggressive seductress, and although i had resisted a couple of other girls at that time, and i even tried to resist her, the shaven sight was too much of a temptation and she had her way with me.

now however i identify as a gender fluid nonbinary lesbian. but since i am not using hormones, no plans for surgery, physically not much has changed, except we're all getting a little older. this is a bit of an issue, as she is late 20s now, and it's hard for women that age to compete with the early 20s, in terms of body attractiveness, but that's beside the point.

now my first problem is my girlfriend is being difficult about having a lesbian threesome with me, and the mother of my oldest daughter. the other woman is fine and down with it, but my girlfriend says she is not sure, and she is not sure she wants to do lesbian sex, in particular she's objecting to performing oral sex on a woman. you can imagine it's not much fun to be dealing with this kind of attitude, but i said, well i'm lesbian, so you are already a lesbian, stop being difficult. well, how can i get my girlfriend to stop spoiling my fun?

also, how can i properly keep tabs on her as right now, covid has meant she is in her country and i am in mine.? is there anyway to remotely install a tracker on her sister's phone that she uses when we chat? if you have physical access, it's easy, but remotely it's no game at all. i don't think there's much she can do, i mean she's in a semi-rural area and has my young daughter and her entire extended family around, so i doubt she's bringing men over but you never know. also, she committed grave acts of abuse to our lesbian union a few years before i met her, as when she was 19 she had a boyfriend at college and she did activities with him that are a terrible stain on our lesbian relationship.

the other thing is while we were out of contact, i hit up a friendship with a younger girl who was 21 then and 22 now. she is more attractive, and possibly more chaste. basically, i'm going to have to marry my daughter's mother to get them here to a rich country, that is duty, but i lso want to have a lesbian marriage with the 22 year old. are there any exemptions for translesbians to allow me to marry them both? if not, i will have to do the marriages in different countries which is a hassle.

finally, what are your views on pushing the older one - so the mother of my youngest - to get a hysterectomy - this would prevent her straying or having a baby with another man, both of which would i believe greatly soil and stain the integrity of our lesbian love.

what is your advice, she speaks english as a second language, so if i used the language barrier to trick her into getting a hysterectomy, could i be legally liable? how can i get her to loosen re: a threesome with me and my oldest kid's mother?

thank you.

i re-entered the hotel to ask them about it and they informed me that the lawyer across the street was a stickler for parking violations and gets joy from throwing those on peoples cars. 

still not understanding what my violation was i walked across the street and entered the office to ask. his secretary informed me that i was parked too close to the fire hydrant and handed me a copy of the city code. i read the code and found that the city states that you must be 10’ from the fire hydrant. i then pulled out my tape measure and measured as i was well clear of the hydrant. i measured 9’6”. i’m just barely in violation. 

i decided to accept my fate and began attempting to peel the sticker from my windshield. i found that it was not budging. i used wiper fluid and no luck. this has to be some kind of vandalism, right?!

so, i contact the police to report vandalism. the officer came out and said that this guy is a known problem and even had a police car towed at one point but unfortunately knows the law well and was not in violation by doing this to my car. they gave me a report and left.

479,: some tips for purging unwanted calories,"**disclaimer:** this is based on personal experience, and is non-scientific. whatever experiences i share may not apply to you, as every human body is different in some way. therefore, i am not responsible for any harm that this guide may cause. follow this guide at your own discretion.


---


**introduction:**

* things you will need:

 * a spare toothbrush
 * the normal toothbrush you brush your teeth with
 * disinfectant to clean your toilet bowl
 * (optional) a towel to wipe your face after washing it
 * lots of water to drink

* there are two different types of purging that i use for different purposes: a half purge and a full purge. 
   *  half purge: for when you've had a little too much food, but you're still okay with a portion of the calorie intake that you've consumed (recommended)
 * full purge: when you've had an all-out feast as a midnight snack and experience ""glutton's remorse."" 
* i recommend you purge your food about 10-25 minutes after you've consumed your food since your body will have been tricked into being satisfied in your tummy even after purging.


---

**how-to:**

1. position your body so that when the partially digested food is leaving your body, that it hits the side of the toilet bowl. this is to avoid any unnecessary splashing.
2. take a few large breaths to prepare yourself. the last thing you want is to panic and to choke on your own vomit.
3. once mentally ready, use your spare toothbrush to gag yourself until the food is forced to leave. 
4. take a few deep breaths, then continue until satisfied with the amount of food that's left your stomach. consider the amount of food you consumed and compare that with how much has left your body
 * for full purges, you will know when most of the food has escaped when you start tasting the stomach acid in your mouth
5. once satisfied, flush the toilet and rinse your mouth. this is where you want to brush your teeth in an attempt to get rid of the remaining and lingering stomach in your mouth.
6. rinse your face and wipe with towel. you will most likely have tears and snot running out of your other holes in your head.
7. drink lots of water.

---

**things to take note of:**

* sometimes, you will want to take a breath, but food is still leaving your body. stay calm and attempt to push all the food out. panicking and attempting to inhale will most likely end very poorly.
* you might have gained weight slightly despite purging. so be it. it's normal for your body to gain weight when you consume food, and the small weight gain will be much better than the weight gain you would've had if you had let your body process all that junk you ate.
* sometimes the vomit will push through your nose. yikes, i don't know how else to make you feel better. better luck next time!

489, request - downstairs neighbor tazmanian child of garbage people need to learn to stop stomping at 8am,"as an apartment dweller, i have always chosen to live on the second story or top story, due to my first living experience where my upstairs neighbors would fight and stomp around all hours of the day and night. it seems i've found myself in the reverse situation, living on the second story with neighbors that seem to have an overly energetic toddler (or toddlers, i can't even be sure) that like to walk with the weight of 20 bricks on each foot, beginning the day with a marathon around the apartment at 7-8 am. now, i'm currently stuck working from home due to covid, so i can't even escape the inconsiderateness of a daily commute.

we previously had downstairs neighbors that we could hear snoring every night until 2 am. to our short-lived relief, they moved out. only 2 days after they had fully moved out (i think a one-day cleaning and the next day for a viewing) these garbage people moved in. i will grant that the apartment complex itself is pretty trash, however, even so, the lack they of parenting, and consideration these trash humans demonstrate for other people, and the amount of noise they are making is **absolutely** infuriating. nothing bothers me more than loud, inconsiderate people. i know they have a toddler that can't help themselves. their unit has hardwood flooring, (common for the ground floor) but i don't see why that permits them to disturb my sleep in the repeated, incessant way that they do.

i call them ""garbage people"" because they seem to have little decency. they smoke out their front door (on non-smoking premises), and they slam every single door or window they touch. plus, they are frequently having people over (literally within the first week of living here) during a shelter in place county issue, doubling their toddler count, and of course, their noise level. i documented the fact that they smoke right on their front step (complete with a cigarette butt, ashtray, and lighter) - other than the stomping and barring blasting music at all hours (there are officially quiet times 8 am-10 pm at the complex), are there any unethical ideas y'all can fill my revenge soul with, as i burn and stew in anger (i own a cat and don't want to use a high-frequency emitter - or random noise emitters, as i have no way to place them in their apartment.)",UnethicalLifeProTips

so i'm looking for a way, or an illiness i could fake easily that could get me a doctor's note saying i can't attend gym class for the whole year. i can't afford to go to the doctor every single week to get a doctor note for some migraine or stomach flu for the week, that's why i'm looking for something that could last all year, a definitive exemption.

608, request: how to stop ex-boss from virtually harassing me,"background info: i was (17f) at my old job when they hired a new (32m) manager. he groomed me into doing sexual acts to him at the workplace and threatened to fire me if i came forward about any of it. i was still in high school and vary naive. i eventually found out he had a girlfriend in another state, so i messaged her and told her what he was doing, thinking i was warning her about his awful behavior and thinking she would believe me and help me. she was super nice and grateful that i told her. 

after that, the messages started. 

he used a texting app (textnow) and email spoofer to write extremely disturbing messages about me to all of my friends, family, coworkers, owners of the store i worked at, and once even a guy i met from tinder. i personally received hundreds of messages, each one taking shots at my insecurities. 
the messages ranged from outing my bi-sexuality to my parents, to saying things like “your teeth are fucked up and you’ll never be as pretty as your sister”. for a long time my manager told me he was getting them too, and also told me his girlfriend was receiving awful ones as well. he blamed it all on an “anonymous stalker” that knew everything about me and my life. 

believing i had a stalker, i became reclusive and cut off a lot of my friends, not knowing who was doing it. 

i did what everyone told me to do which is collect all the emails, print them out, and go to the police. they told me “you can’t prove whose behind a computer” and left it at that. i went to 2 police stations in different cities and tried talking to private investigators. i even tried contacting the da for my state. i did try to contact lawyers. 

it turns out he was blaming the messages on me, lying and saying i was a “young distraught teenager that was upset because i had a crush on him” - (i imagine to try and justify to his girlfriend why a young girl was contacting her saying these things about what he did to me) and his girlfriend ended up believing himpursuing legal action against me and filed a restraining order saying i was the one messaging both of them. since i sent the initial message to warn her, they had evidence against me. when someone gets a restraining order on you in another state, you have to either fly there to appeal it in court yourself or hire a lawyer to go for you. i tried calling the court to explain and they said tough, you or a lawyer need to be here. i was just starting my 2nd semester of college at this point and had 0 dollars to fly out to a state i’ve never even been to before, so i didn’t appeal it. i’m not even sending the messages in the first place so what am i supposed to stop doing? 

this all happened 5 years ago. since then i quit that job, made all of my accounts super private, dropped out of college due to depression, started a new career, moved across the country to california, and changed my phone number 5 times. 

i still get horrible weekly messages from fake instagram accounts. i block each time and he just makes a new one. i am staying at my sisters house in cali and she just got a text with her exact address threatening to send a ‘gift’ to her. from a spoofed number (she just moved here a few months ago, no clue how he found her address) and a few weeks ago one of my new clients got a spoofed email telling them not to trust me because i’m crazy. 

i can’t trace the messages. i spent way way way too much time trying to prove who is sending them. i know with 100% certainty it is him sending them, but i can’t prove it or take legal action because current laws don’t apply unless you can prove who is doing it.

i’m very desperate and could use any advice on what to do to make it stop. this problems been tainting my life for years and makes me fear that anyone i get close to will get harassed by these messages next. sos",UnethicalLifeProTips

up  until now, i was planning to get the support of other coworkers who had  been abused by her and file a formal complaint with the partners. she  is already in poor standing with the firm due to her incompetence, so i  figured this complaint could be the final stroke to bring her to her  knees.

unfortunately however, i  just found out that she was planning to leave the firm. this was  confided to me, so i am assuming the partners don't know she is actively  looking for work/sitting interviews.

my  plan currently is to use a tip i saw on here recently - put her number  on craigslist advertising a free/heavily discounted x-series/ps5,  causing her to change her number. this will create a huge headache as  she will have to communicate with prospecting employers that she has  changed numbers and may even miss some calls, causing her to forgo some  opportunities. during this set back, i will go forward with my original  plan, and hopefully (ideally) push her out with no opportunities on the  horizon.

ps  i am from india and the reason for not working in one single company is because in india the majority of private companies delay salaries up to even 20 days. in india, we are paid monthly. the standard practice is:  the salaries get credited between 7th and 10th of the month, but many companies delay salaries to keep the cash flow for other things. and there is no concept of overtime payment, if they want they can order us to be at worksite till the work is over. in india, we have two choices,  either resign from the company and hope that the next company will be better or keep getting the shitty treatment.",UnethicalLifeProTips

704, request: how to deal with a disrespectful neighbor who repeatedly violates boundaries,"hi, i would like some pro tips (unethical or ethical) on how to deal with my neighbor who is male and 61 years old. i am female and 28 years old. 

since he moved in next door last year, his behavior makes me uncomfortable. i got a bad feeling the first time we met. **he has made strange requests:** 

* to share the same garbage can (because he doesn't produce a lot of garbage and wants to use my can)
* to keep the stairwell light off (we share one stairwell to access both apartments. without the light, it is pitch black and i cannot see outside my front door. he said he wanted to conserve energy)
* help him set up his wifi (this request was after 9pm at night)
* use my mailbox to store his things **(current problem)**

**other strange behaviors:**

* picks up my packages for me and puts them outside my door (i never asked him to do this). he tried to message me on facebook from looking at my legal name on my mail. i blocked him immediately.
* yelling my name at me from his window when i am outside walking (i always ignore him)
* leaving his apartment when i leave my apartment to ask me a question (follows me to my car, the garbage alley, etc.)
* opens his front door the minute he hears my footsteps entering the shared stairwell or leaving my front door (never wearing a face mask)
* comments on how good the cooking from my apartment smells 

i never initiate any conversations. i keep the conversations as short as possible, using a lot of negative language like ""no"", ""not interested"", ""stop"", ""don't"", and look him directly in the eye when doing so. i document all the dates/times/locations of all interactions. i got along well with the neighbor who used to live in that apartment, and even then we have never talked as much as this man wants to talk to me.

any advice on how to deal with him? i recently discovered today that he is using my mailbox to store his things, like aaa batteries and a key to the outside storage unit where he stores his bike, which is his only form of transportation. i'm not sure if he has the landlord's permission to use the storage unit, because the key is usually kept in an obvious location where anyone can see it. 

i don't understand why he just doesn't put the key in his mailbox or put it on his keyring to use. everything he does is for his convenience, and he violates common sense boundaries as a neighbor. when the bike is not in the outside storage room, he locks it to another neighbor's electricity meter. (is that illegal?) i imagine he did not ask that neighbor for permission.

i threw away the batteries i found yesterday, and now there are new batteries in my mailbox. i don't know what they're used for, but i threw them away again. the storage shed key slipped from my hand and went into a crevice into the wall - it's not impossible to retrieve, but not obvious to the naked eye. what should i do if he confronts me about the missing key and batteries? how can i address his behavior and make sure we never talk again?

if this business pays for ads to get them placed at the top of google searches, they pay when those ads get clicked on. depending on what they are advertising, they can pay anywhere from a few cents to $10 per click or more. 

simply search for the terms that led you to find them in the first place (not their brand name) and click on their ad. think something like ""car ac repair"" instead of ""bob's auto"".

you just cost them money. 

do it again the next day. more money. 

use a different browser. sign out of your google account. click. more money.

have a brother or sister living nearby? ask them for a click. more money.

it doesn't stop there. chances are that unless you are running ad blockers they dropped a facebook cookie into your browser the first time you clicked on their ad. 

jump into fb and scroll a bit. if you see their ad, click. more money. 

not seeing their ad on fb? no problem, just search for them in the fb search bar and visit their company page. now you should start seeing ads in fb if they are advertising there too. 

click, more money. 

the trick is to play the long game here. don't try clicking 100 times in a day from the same place. that is unnatural. 

a click here and a click there over time. google, fb, maybe yelp (expensive!). 

and don't forget to leave scathing yet **honest** reviews all over the place. feel free to copy/paste one original review you write and blast it all over the place: google, bbb, fb (though if it's their page they'll most likely suppress it, yelp and any other online property that pops up on the first two pages of google after your search for their company name. 

one lost customer because of your poor review can more than make up for the money they cheated you out of. plus they may end up having to spend more money to try and cover up the poor reviews if you aren't alone.

if you want to take it to the next step find your state's attorney general website. there should be a place for your to file an online complaint about the company that did you dirty (you might need to find the state ag for where the company is headquartered if it's not a local business). it will most likely lead to nothing, but it's not something fun to receive and if they have to handle it, more time and money.

792,: bought a new appliance but didn't get a good deal? dint it upon installing and get a discount.,"many home good stores offer installation of a new appliance for a fee. normally, if your fridge, stove, washer/drier, etc. show up damaged they will offer you money back regardless if it still works or not (i literally just got 20% off my washer for a quarter sized dent). 

unfortunately though, sometimes things show up in perfect condition. fear not though, many of you have a hammer at home that can leave a nice little dent in the side that nobody will see. if you don't want to permanently damage your new product, find a screw and over tighten it- this will cause the metal to bow long enough for you to take a picture of your ""damaged"" product.

this employee was an absolute bitch, who broke up several marriages, harassed several female employees she found to be ""in competition"" with her, and spent all her time spying on her co-workers to get them in trouble. safe to say, we don't want her ass back.
unfortunately, our supervisor is bff's with her, and has fast-tracked her into the interview process, meaning she has already passed her background investigation despite the criminal charges. they are taking advantage of the fact that her probation just ended, we are in a staffing crisis,  and that we have a new city manager who doesn't hate her as much.

my professor and i don't necessarily see eye to eye, but when they proposed a research paper on a topic that is right up my field of expertise, i jumped the gun and began writing.

i've had a few of my previous works publicized in journals for the subject before, and i figured that i would be able to get this one as well. as a result, i went over the word length by 2x (8000 words instead of the assigned 4000). along the way, i made sure to get my essay peer reviewed by other researchers to make sure everything was on the level. 

i decided to be courteous and inform my professor that i was submitting over the word limit in the hopes of developing this into another thesis. the professor immediately shot it down, saying that they wouldn't provide feedback or accept the assignment over the limit, and to treat the 4000 words as a ""challenge"".

if you say something like that what servers hears immediately is “i’m a bad tipper” and we stop caring about your table.  

so if you think things are expensive keep it to yourself.  (honestly most servers like it better that way, we’d rather find out later that you’re a sh*t tipper and not when you first sit down).

to spite the camp, we all started peeing in the floor vents in the cabin. literally every time we had to pee, for a week straight. it was summer so the heat was off. but i can only imagine how that smelled once the heat got turned on, after the pee had been seeping into the system and rotting there for months. and they would have no idea where the smells coming from.

870, the real guide on how to hide a body.," pulverize all teeth, burn off fingerprints, and disfigure the face. forcing a dna test to establish identity (if it ever comes to that) might introduce the legal/forensic hurdle that saves your ass down the line., an unidentifiable body can, in a pinch, be dressed in thrift store clothes and dropped in a bad part of town where the police are less likely to question it.  i don't recommend that disposal method, i'm just saying an easily identifiable body is an even bigger threat than the opposite. assuming you have it inside a house where you can work on it a bit, the first thing you want to do is drain it of fluids.  this will make it easier to cut up, and slow decomposition a little bit.  the best way to do this quick and dirty is to perforate the body with a pointed knife, and then perform cpr on it.  cut the fronts of the thighs deep, diagonally, to slit the femoral arteries. then pump the chest.  the valves in the heart will still work when dead, and the springback of the ribcage can put apply a fair amount of suction to the artria.  do this in a tub. plug the drain, and mingle lots of bleach with the bodily fluids before unplugging the drain to empty the tub.  this should help control the stench of death, which would otherwise reek from your gutter gratings. do everything you can to control odors.  plug in an ionizer, burn candles, leave bowls of baking soda everywhere. ventilate the room in the middle of the night, but otherwise keep it closed.  keep the body under a plastic sheet while it's in the tub. if you want to bury, i recommend seperating the body into several parts, and burying them seperately.  for one thing, it's easier to dig a deep enough hole for a head than for an entire body.  this reduces your chances of being discovered while you are actually outside and digging the grave. that is the one thing you can't do inside the doors of your house, and represents a vulnerable moment you want to keep brief, under 2 hours.  do it between 3 and 5 am. it's also less likely for someone to call the police if their dog digs up some chunk of meat, than if they dig up an enitre body.  they may assume it's an animal carcass disfigured by decomposition, and leave it alone or dispose of it.  it's also more likely that the dog will consume all of it before anyone knows the difference. a whole skeleton is another story.  you can cut a body into 6 pieces faster than you think. it's not much different than boning a chicken, but it takes more work, a big knife, and time.  a hammer will be useful for pulverizing joints or driving the knife deep where it doesn't want to go.  anyway it's wise to crush as much of the skeleton as you can along the way. it will aid in making the body less identifiable for what it is as it decomposes. don't return to the same site 6 times for 6 burials. you'll attract suspicion from anyone nearby, and you'll wind up placing the body parts close enough together to be found by any serious investigation.  put them in plastic bags with lots of bleach, and store in a freezer until you have enough time to bury them all. depending on what tools you have available, you may find that you're get really good at deconstructing the body. you might prefer to slowly sprinkle it down a drain without leaving your house. this avoids the long-term risk of discovery associated with burial,  and the overwhelming supply of bacteria in a sewer accellerates deconomposition, while providing a convenient cover smell. truly grinding down a body takes a lot more work, and you run the risk of fouling your plumbing and calling in a plumber.  so don't try it unless you know how to clear bones and meat out of a drainpipe. a good food processor can be useful.  but don't over-use it, or power drills or saws. they're noisy and they attract attention. and forget the kitchen sink.  it's better if you actually remove one of the toilets in your house from its base,  which will give you direct access to one of the largest sewer pipes that enters your house.  follow any disposals with lots of bleach and then run the water for 5 or 10 minutes on top of that.  and plug that pipe when you're not using it, to prevent any sewer gasses from backing up into your house.  usually, a u-trap inside the toilet does that for you. don't ever bury a dead body in an area with little to no vegetation. the high nitrogen content in our bodies helps plant to grow and  there will be a weird grassy patch at the top of burial site and anyone would be able to spot it. you can neutralize the smell of a rotting corpse by covering it with the ashes of a common camp fire. hardwood ash will work, softer more resinous woods like pine wont. if you feed a human body to pigs, they will eat just about all of it except the teeth. if your local forest has a number of medium to large sized carnivorous predators, you can cover a body in salmon or sardine oil and dump it in that forest and surely less than a couple days the body will already be eaten beyond recognition.",UnethicalLifeProTips

873,: record and upload all your university lectures and material to the internet for the world to see!,"if you live in a one-party consent region, then it's legal to record your classes if you're involved in them. since there are no laws (at least in north america that i know of) that prevent the sharing of information as long as you're not profiting off it (potential copyright issues), or bound by an nda (non disclosure agreement), then you can freely upload lecture recordings to the internet for the world to see and learn from.

you might wrongly think this sounds ethical, giving others the opportunity to learn for free, but universities make profits from giving out degrees and teaching their students. if this information is widely available, it might cut down on profits, and have less students taking electives, or coming to the university altogether. i envision a piratebay style resource for the upper echelon university lectures.

of course, if you don't live in a one-party consent region, you could also just share the documentation, pdfs, lecture slides, and all that. again, not illegal, just mildly unethical.

online lectures such as zoom make this even easier too, as you can use your computer to screen record, or even download if the professors share them. the only concern might be university policy, but they can't stop you from sharing the information they've given to you, especially if it's after you've graduated.

for example, if you remember that something was $4.99, you can say ""um... i'm pretty sure it was $2.99 but you can check if you'd like."" 

i worked retail for years, as a cashier and then a cashier supervisor. 9 times out of 10 they don't want to go check, so they'll just input the item as ""miscellaneous merchandise"" and manually set whatever price you say. on the off chance they do check, you can just say ""oh i'm sorry, i must have read the sign wrong.""

only go like 1-3 dollars below what it actually is (if something is $16.99 don't say it was $1) and keep the same cent amount (so if it was $4.98 keep the .98 and say $2.98 or $3.98 for example.)

the work emails i have aren't really useful, however i continue to have access to my .edu address from university, now that shit comes in very handy. my university is continuing to pay for my adobe creative cloud subscription 3 years after leaving, and i have so many student discounts on the go it's unreal.

to complicate things, my old company got bought out back in around 2016 or so? however, all the online sites that specify this say it wasn't bought/transitioned until summer of 2020.

i see currently there are many banks hiring (one of the few industries hiring now, go figure)... i know they do extensive background checks. would this kind of technique work for a bank job??

or it would probably only work with standard work experience background checks?

what could be a good plan for this? i could possibly use a fake reference company (which ones work well?)... money is tight though, so are there other alternatives like putting a fake manager name and a fake number?

there's also the problem of old resumes floating around on job boards and with recruiters. so, i would probably need to change them there or take those offline for now and just manually apply to jobs online?

i could also fake a company, but i have yet to find an out of business technology it company! it's not easy to find! any suggestions here? i've been looking for out of business it companies that were closed recently, and i haven't found yet.

**technique helps expel alcohol that goes from the blood to lungs through evaporation**


the canadian press · posted: nov 12, 2020 1:36 pm et | last updated: 4 hours ago



lead researcher joseph fisher, a senior scientist at the university health network's toronto general hospital research institute, says each exhalation contains alcohol that has evaporated from the blood into the lungs and that hyperventilating, under medical supervision, can speed that process. (university health network/handout via the canadian press)


canadian researchers say they've developed a game-changing method to treat alcohol poisoning — and it involves literally breathing alcohol out of the body by hyperventilating.

for example let’s say you can fill a melting chamber for pennies with $1,000 of pennies or 100,000 pennies. let’s say you make $25 profit off this. to ensure a supply for melting you could have someone who takes pennies from the mint and distributes pennies and just gives them to you and you give the mint the metal to make the pennies again you could technically maintain a small profit margin based off of this estimate for profit that may be overestimated.  i know this is near impossible to accomplish, but hypothetically is it possible to gain a certain level of profit at a large scale",UnethicalLifeProTips

1023, (for business owners?) a business which pays cash in hand and below minimum wage may make more money by paying legitimate wages through taxes,"he title may sound dumb but let me explain. if you get paid cash in hand, it isn't on the books, so the business may not be able to write this off as an expense (wages). not accounting for expenses = more profit on the books = more paid in taxes.

on top of this, a business which isn't operating fully legally will often scoop up the cash from the till and not record this money as revenue. the issue is, since you're paying cash in hand, this cash is used to pay wages. if you were paying through a bank account legitimately, you get to keep all the money in the till to yourself, which once again lowers profit and therefore taxes.

this happens every damn early morning and exactly before 6pm. sometimes their mom contributes to the noise, often screaming at them 

it's annoying. frustrating and just stupid. i thought of ideas...

1. bringing a friend over and having her ""complain"" out loud to say ""oh wow i really hate that you got noisy neighbor kids""

2. buying a drone or something like that and flying it over everytime they keep screaming

3. screaming myself or bringing out the rock and roll stereo

i think i like the third option, i'll just play every time they scream. they'll probably get the point but  i don't want to start any noise wars or build unnecessary attrition

if you’ve had any loan or credit card in the past make a claim of unaffordable lending, they’ve got to prove that they ran the relevant affordability checks before giving you cards or loans

if you’ve got a current debt complain about your mental health and how the calls are driving you suicidal, often gets debts written off before even raising that one with an ombudsman.

if any debts have been passed to a debt collection agency ask for the original credit agreement and affordability checks to be sent to you. raise an official complaint about every dealing you have with the original creditor and the debt collection company.

i do pretty well for myself, i have a nice house, a brand new mercedes, some cash in the bank and i still complain about every single little thing i can. pay your credit cards on time, pay your mortgage on time, fuck everyone else over.

when i handed my old mercedes back 2 years ago i owed £2,600 in mileage charges, after they sent some letters with some errors on i complained about it causing me anxiety which stopped me working overtime and caused me significant financial damage, they knocked £450 off before i even forwarded it to the ombudsman, i still haven’t paid a penny while the ombudsman is looking into it and they can’t report it on my credit file until the matter is resolved. 

similarly i had some old, unenforceable debts, i waited a couple of years and then asked for original credit agreements and affordability checks and they were then written off.

i made a claim against a company which loaned me money for a car years ago, i won the affordability checks claim and they had to return all interest paid and remove any bad records from my credit file even though i had thousands in the bank and have around £2,000 disposable income every month.

when with a debt collection company threatening suicide often gets the account put through for write off too, you may have to deal with police coming around though to check on you. doesn’t usually work with the original creditor but almost always works once it’s been passed on.

note: if you’ve not got a mortgage yet and are planning to get one soon i’d look into the affects on your credit cards. checking if a company did affordability checks won’t affect you negatively but not paying bills for months in the hopes they’re passed on to a debt collection agency will.",UnethicalLifeProTips

1095, : he gave me herpes and lied about everything," i am sharing this story about wolfgang kristof petermann because he has ruined a part of my life and has ruined many women's lives. i feel that if i don’t share his story, he will continue to spread stds and ruin more people's lives. this information is not a lie or trivial gossip; it is a truthful account of my interactions with wolfgang. i want to put the facts out there and treat this as my safe space to talk about my experiences and have a public record to warn others, in case anyone ever researches his background. this is not only my story but also the stories of many other women, who he has done the same or similar things to. this is the only way i know how to prevent him from doing this to other people, by holding him accountable for his deceitful words and actions.

first, some background information: wolfgang is from detroit, michigan and graduated from the university of michigan before joining the military. he is a 29 years old officer in the us army and has been stationed all over the world. he has a history of meeting and dating women from dating apps such as hinge and bumble, but also meets them through work and real life.

i met him through bumble while living in hawaii. he seemed nice on our first date, just like a normal good guy at first. i felt like he was genuine, caring, and someone who wanted to build a normal relationship with me. before we were ever physically intimate, i asked him during one of our early conversations if he has ever had a std or sti and he said no. little did i know, this would be the start of the hundreds of lies he has told and will continue to tell. 

before we had sex for the first time, i confronted him and asked if he had been tested for stds/stis and he told me he got the full panel done (meaning a urine test and blood work). however, he never showed me the confirmed results and told me he was negative and that he had not been with anyone since he got the test done two months before meeting me. i found out he lied via his ex girlfriend b, who contacted me and clarified with me that he told his ex before her, a, gave him chlamydia, but in reality he was the one that gave a chlamydia. not only did he lie about having stds/stis, he ended up giving me genital herpes which is incurable and will stay with me for the rest of my life, along with all associated self-image issues and shame. 

another example of his lying habit, he lied and told me he was taking a trip to la to meet up with his best friend buck. he even got his friend buck to send him fake texts to create the illusion that he was spending the trip with buck. he lied and told me he got an exemption from the military so he could have the mandatory 14 day quarantine waived on his return to hawaii. he in fact did not report to his commander in chief and ask for permission to go to la so he was actually not exempt from quarantine and therefore broke hawaii state law. he also never even saw buck during his trip. the reality was that he planned the trip to visit his ex, b, and then came right back home to me. he slept with b during his trip to la but did not disclose to her that he gave me genital herpes, that he has it himself, and that he exposed her to it too. even when confronted by b, he told her his test results were negative but would not admit to whether or not he has herpes. both of our doctors told us that he could have been asymptomatic at the time of taking the blood sample and that his blood test could still come back negative. he didn’t show us (b and me) the test results until weeks after the results were posted to his health records. the results came back positive for hsv1 and said his positive index was higher than normal which indicates he was probably shedding the viral load (and oral herpes can be passed on to someone else as genital herpes as well especially when the timing of events with us all align with the incubation period).   

i know this may all sound like petty relationship drama but to all the girls he has lied to and screwed over, it’s not. this affects me, the previous women in his life, and the lives of future women he may be interested in. i know i am still the one that made the decision to sleep with him and i will take responsibilities for my actions. i will have to live with this shame, guilt, and trust issues everyday for the rest of my life and will do my best to overcome them. what i cannot let go and let him walk free from are the lies and the manipulation he’s done to me and other people. he has lied about so much more than just the few examples i mentioned above. additionally, he has kept nude photos of ex-girlfriends before, stored on a cloud drive, which is a complete violation of trust, respect, and personal privacy. he has manipulated and lied so much just to keep women around all over the world. 

wolfgang is not an honest person. he has no dignity or integrity, and he is not honorable. how can someone this untrustworthy be allowed to serve in the military that serves our country? how can we truly trust him with anything? 

my intention truly isn't to destroy his life but to keep him honest. i want him to understand the damage he's done and actually want to change and get professional help for his issues and become a better human being. and hopefully one day when he meets someone, he will have worked on himself and is honest with people to have an open dialogue about his past self. someone like this shouldn't be able to just walk free without consequences and keep doing this to other people. i just want there to be a record of what he's done so that maybe, some girl who will be in my situation can find this and read it before it's too late.",UnethicalLifeProTips

1111,": with christmas fast approaching, here is a tool i just discovered to instantly turn gift cards into cash.","so this isn't illegal, and only unethical depending on your intentions. i figured some people may find this very useful and thought i'd share. 

i somehow stumbled upon an app called ""prepaid cash"", which allows you to convert gift cards into cash, instantly. i have used the service twice now, both with those prepaid visa gift cards that, on their own, do not allow for atm or cashback access. it worked flawlessly both times. 

the fees are fairly steep, though i find them to be worth it. i received $42 for a $50 giftcard. 

the process is quick and easy. i took a picture of the front and back of each card, the app processed the card info correctly on the first try. after that, you enter the value of the giftcard (i believe they accept values of $25-$500). submit the transaction and then choose your payment method (i chose instant deposit to my debit card). it was approved in seconds, and by the time i opened my banking app and signed in, the money was there. 

their app says they accept all sorts of giftcards from over 75 different retailers, not just the visa or mastercard prepaid, but i have not explored or tried any other type of giftcards. 

and before you ask or go witch hunting, i am in no way affiliated with this app oer recieving anything to share this. i simply thought it could help some people out who may be strapped for cash or those who have families deadset on gifting giftcards for the holidays.",UnethicalLifeProTips

1124,": if you're phoning a call center about an ongoing issue, and you've been passed around the departments, don't start the call by complaining about it.","i used to work in a call center, in fact i've worked in several, and i've dealt with the full gamut of customer complaints. it was (and is) quite common for call center reps to just pass the buck when they encountered a difficult customer. they would put them on hold and leave them on hold until the customer hung up or cold transfer them to another department. 

this led to some very bewildered and frustrated customers. when one of those customers came through, they would sometimes start the call by shrieking: ""i've been on the phone for three hours and you're the tenth person i've spoken to! what is going on?!"" 

i used to call them 'poisoned chalices'. when a customer came on the line ranting like this, my first thought was: ""why could the previous 9 advisors not help the customer?"" my second thought was ""is it possible for me to help the customer?"" (to which the answer was usually no) and my third and final thought was:

""how am i going to get rid of this whining wretch?"" 

if i was having a bad day (which was frequent) i would either give them the hold music treatment until they hung up or drop them through to another poor soul in a different department.

the smart customers would keep a cool head and just give me their account details or reference number, wait until i was in their account, then do a disconcerting gear change into angry customer mode.

1146,: a guide to shoplifting,"i've seen so many impractical and overly elaborate shoplifting tricks here that i felt compelled to write my own list down. this is meant for ""casual"", long term shoplifting, not heists, and it's everything i myself have been doing in the past. i pride myself in never having been caught, and during a time i was really broke i would practically only steal for two years or so (and regularly from the same places). i wanna add though that according to my own set of morals, i can only condone stealing from corporations or shops where no real person will be harmed - i firmly disagree with stealing from independent, smaller businesses. only steal when necessary and don't let it get to you - it becomes addictive quickly. onto the list.



avoiding being caught 

- always be friendly. firstly, it will often get you off the hook if you do get caught. secondly, whoever you're talking to is likely only doing their job or trying to do what they think is right. be kind. there's no point in being rude
- act natural and casual. never make a big deal out of slipping something in your pocket. people don't care half as much as you think, but they will notice if you behave suspiciously
- be confident. i have gotten away with holding a stolen product in my hands walking out so many times just because i made it look like it was supposed to be that way. you can not be to confident. chat with employees if it comes to it. smile at security if they catch your eye. never behave like someone who's aware they're doing something wrong
- make it look accidental. i like to balance phone, money and whatever else in my hands so that it looks like i have my hands and mind full, take a product, and put it in my pocket as if i just didn't pay attention. if you're being watched, you can play this off as an accident and return the product easily. 
- if you have no money and can't pay for any product, it helps to be with friends who are buying something. slip it in your pocket, stick to a group, chat, keep busy 
- slipping small items in your sleeves or, better yet, into your underwear usually works pretty well if you can do it in a casual way. however, if you get caught you won't have a way out of this.
- talking on the phone (or pretending) will make people who might suspect something less willing to talk to you
- generally, appearing busy, having your hands full or looking stressed will drive people away from questioning you and give you a good excuse if they do, most people can relate to forgetting you had something in your pocket if you seem like you have too much on your hands
- ideally, always bring money so that you can pay if it comes to it
- be aware of cameras but don't stare at them. check where they are casually or go to the place you wanna steal from more often so that you'll eventually know where they are
- have excuses ready from the start, know your go-to
- ""forget"" something in the bag and pay for the rest, if you're nice and friendly, people will usually believe it. even keeping something in your hand can work. play it off, apologise, say you had a busy day. again, act natural. act like you're not aware of any guilt, just clumsy
- understand that people will assume that if you're stealing, you're trying to hide it. the less obviously you hide something, the less suspicion you raise and the less likely people will think you meant to steal if you get caught
- pro tip: get an idea of the place you're stealing from. find a product, a device, an automat or whatever near the entrance behind the checkout. if you're unsure whether you're being watched, go to that product and stay there for a short moment, acting like you're using/looking at something. if you're being watched, you'll be approached here and you can argue you were just doing something. if no one approaches you, you're good to go
- alternatively, once you're done stealing, pretend to leave the supermarket but stand at the door (on the inside) and act like you're looking/waiting for someone (ideally also pretend to be on the phone with that person). again, if someone is suspicious, they will approach you now and you can say you were waiting for your friend to join you and shop together (then after a while proceed to pay normally, obviously). if you're not being approached, you're good to go
- ideally, pick the checkout with the friendliest cashier if you know them (or one that appears friendly) 


figuring out the signs that you have been caught before you're confronted (and reacting to confrontation). these have saved me a lot

- usually, several employees will eye you if you've been seen slipping something in your pocket. they'll be talking quietly on their headsets. sometimes you can even see security or an employee running to the checkout before you're there to catch you. in that case, remain calm
- you have three options here
a) continue to checkout and pay for your items. can be painful, but is the safest way. they might give you a warning but they won't do anything more usually
b) return all the items and leave empty-handed. this will look suspicious. i usually pretend like i'm getting a call or looking for my wallet or checking it and then act like i forgot it/have no money. then i'll return it. this gives you an excuse, even though people will usually remain suspicious
c) pay for some of the items and steal some or return some and steal the rest. this is bold, but it has worked for me. they will confront you and you won't look good, tell them some story, they won't believe it but since you're paying for half, they usually won't check because they'll assume they already ""caught"" you and you're admitting guilt by paying/returning, so they usually won't check

1153,: never spend more then fifteen minutes disputing an issue again,"after making a purchase, trouble shooting a service, or dealing with anything that requires you to reach out. never spend more then fifteen minutes.  your time has value. 

most of the time there is a long wait on hold, followed by someone that just follows a script that can't help you anyway. no respect for your time. however you can change with minimal effort.  for a one time investment cost. 

that investment cost is to head to your local court house .  pick yourself up a small claims form (if not available online, most aren't because they are behind the times).   if your not able to scan it yourself have a copy center do it for you on to a flash drive. investment process complete. 

moving forward. once the fifteen mark is hit. hang up.  takes all of ten minutes to fill it out and post date it. you can attached that to e-mail response that you'll mail it out by the end of the week if not resolved. that typically gets results but not always.  or if you just can't be bothered and your just done with it, mail it to the court house.  you may need to pay up to one hundred dollars for the hearing. 

most of the time the company will reach out to you and settle, including the refund for the court hearing.  the others that don't respond, you win by default and the company sends you a check. default ruling amount for what you asked for, plus the one hundred dollar court cost.  

each state is different. some states require a company representative as some states don't allow lawyers in small claims.  it's expensive of sending a rep out or even hiring a lawyer isn't worth the $35 refund your asking for. fiscally it's just cheaper to deal with you directly and get it over with. 

if they do try to settle they reached out to you, had the power to help and did because they were helping themselves in the process. 

you don't even have to go to court on the day of the trail if the company didn't respond. it the company shows up to the court that day it's continued and you are notified of the new court date to which you will to attend. otherwise you get a copy of the judgment in the mail that you won by default. 

what's the worse that can happen?  i'm in one of those states that don't allow attorneys in small claims court.  about six years ago i sued for $1,700.  the company hired a local attorney to escalate it up to the next court level so they could have legal representation.  

they did send the form making the request, only a day after the hearing and they also forgot to sign it. two weeks later i had my check. 

it's a pretty useful tool. every window company in my area requires a arbitration agreement. every last damn one of them.  i paid and five months later still had no windows. even knowing i signed that arbitration agreement i told them, well let the courts decide how it should be handled.  out of the gate they knew the investment to deal with me was too great and refunded me my money. 

ten minute trip or so down the road to your local court house is all it takes to save you a lot of time and stress. transfer the ownership of the problem on them instead.",UnethicalLifeProTips

but most services regularly have offers and incentives for new and returning customers. in 2020 alone i’ve managed to get 8 months of streaming for the price of 2. here’s how:

-at the start of the year, spotify was offering 3 months for the price of 1 here in the uk (they do this once or twice a year for anyone).

-then i randomly looked at apple music once this has expired and was immediately offered 1 month free (this wasn’t advertised, just given automatically by the app to encourage my return as soon as i looked at plans)..

-then i jumped onto the free month of amazon prime after this and got to enjoy amazon prime music (i was a new customer, they don’t tend to offer much for returning customers).

-currently i am back on apple music with a 3 months for 1 offer. by the time this expires, spotify will probably restart their 3 for 1 offer.

1182, request- unethical big box merchandise return/exchange,"ong story short: should i swap and return (same make/model/price, brand-new) different color guitar for a full refund?

here’s the dilemma. my employer uses a third-party rewards program in which you are given points that are essentially worth $1 each. the smart thing to do is to use the points for an amazon e-gift card or a prepaid visa. as each point has a real-world value of $1.00, you get the most bang for your buck by doing this

of course, that’s not what i did. i bought a guitar for roughly $30 more than market price from the rewards-center catalog. i realized my error and am returning the guitar for better use of my points. 

here’s the catch: i love the color of the guitar i received from my points ($260) but i went ahead and bought the same guitar in a different color ($229) at big box guitars. i did this knowing i’m getting refunded 260 points when i return the first guitar from my employer. 

what would happen if i “returned” the wrong guitar, in the color i don’t want, to my employer’s reward center? keep in mind that this is the same brand and model as they sent me and is the same price on the market. it’s a third party, so nothing would happen to my job if they caught on. 

would they question the return? would they assume there was a mixup in their inventory, resulting in me receiving the wrong color? would they take legal recourse for fraud? what about serial numbers?

the ethics are questionable since i would be making an exchange of goods without knowledge or permission from the supplier. it seems like no one would be getting hurt, but i know that bureaucratic, corporate policies don’t account for common sense. does anyone on reddit have experience with this sort of grif",UnethicalLifeProTips

i have a buddy that simply said he has a “little one” to take care of at home named charlie (his 1 year old siamese cat), and the person that hired him (at a major international beverage company) literally said they prefer to hire parents because they stay longer in their position, and, even gave him another 15% over the stated starting wage for the position because he was a “family man,” even though he had no experience and it was an entry level position. 

i personally have watched parents that are bad at their jobs get raises and higher starting pay in my field my entire career. there have been bad years when 50% of our staff didn’t get raises, and the majority that did, had children and simply “casually” mentioned that in their annual review or it was already known because they won’t stop talking about them with anyone that will listen. i know this because i’m in middle management, and sit with another manager for all of our reviews (per company policy), then sit with our upper management when these budget decisions are made. having a “family” always plays a major part in considering employee hiring, compensation and retention talks.

you get about 2 weeks of paid training when hired.
you have a 90 day period of an the job training while working and adjusting to the job and duties, during this period you cannot be written up for anything related to the job duties. 

our write up proces is: informal supervision, performance management (write up) you have 30 days to improve, no improvement means a move to corrective action, 30 days to improve. no improvement? you get a final warning and another 30 days and if there is no improvement you are fired. 

this means someone could be hired on and we couldn't fire them for poor performance until 6+ months of not really doing anything.

near the end of the final warning period you could look for another job, same position even just another company, and get hired and start from the beginning as a new hire. past employers are almost never called, no one would know you are on your final write up and you could leave before you are fired. 

alternatively even if you make it to the end of the period and are fired, you could still get another job within enough of a time frame that there isn't a gap in your resume, and even if there was you could just not put that in there.

i really think that she wouldn't be thinking these things if the instagram algorithm hadn't recommended them to her. i want to subtly change the algorithm.

i contacted the supervisor of the social department responsible for my welfare and decided to be honest about it as i was willing to pay taxes on the money earned. he told me i wasn't allowed to work with welfare and the money i earn would be removed from my paycheck; *but* would let it pass considering corona-times, and he'd contact me back in four months to see how it goes.  

since everything is sent to my pay-pal account. i'm worried that somehow the tax-services will somehow get aware of it. the supervisor dude told me i should spend the money, and not frighten about the taxes because moste likely they won't be aware of it.

1310, - bypass honorlock on exams,"honorlock is one of the toughest programs to bypass when it comes to exams. we've all been there before. your professor sucks at teaching an online class and it's causing you to quite literally fail school. your grade is slowly sinking to an 'f' and your gpa is sliding down right behind it. don't panic, because there's a solution.

what you'll need:
• pc (with camera preferably. laptop or desktop)
• phone (it's important this charged adequately prior to exam)
• mouse &amp; usb that came with it
• type-c usb adapter
• tape (duct tape preferably)

if you don't use a mouse, or don't have a usb adapter, both can be purchased for under $15 (look for package deal if you have neither). it is very important that the mouse have a quiet click. personally, i use a vssoplor mouse, almost silent and very cheap on amazon.

here's how you would (theoretically) to do this:

1. go to your phone's settings, and set the ""screen timeout"" to ""never"", and turn on ""do not disturb"". (this is why you want adequate charge. your battery will need to sustain enough screen time to last the duration of the exam). 

note: you may wish to disable ""auto-rotate"" at this point as well, so you phone will not leave landscape mode when you get to the final step 

2. plug the type-c usb adapter into your device.

3. plug the usb for the mouse into your phone, and ensure that you can control the pointer on your phone via the mouse.

4. roll the duct tape in a circle, so that it is a circle with stickiness facing outward all around.

5. put the duct tape on the backmost spot of your keyboard, right where the laptop folds. (for desktop, stick the duct tape at the bottom of the monitor)

6. place your phone on the duct tape (landscape orientation), and ensure it sticks somewhat reasonably. test to make sure do setup works.

7. get ready for your exam. open google on your phone via the mouse and test to ensure keyboard works properly when searching.

when you start your honorlock exam, it will ask you to do a 360° scan of your room and desk. the tape will keep your phone in place, so that nothing is on the desk except your mouse. because honorlock monitors your eyes and flags movement that leaves the screen, you will be safe, as your phone will be resting against it. you may also want to enable swipe texting, or download an app that will allow you to swipe text. honorlock monitors your knuckles, and may flag excessive clicking that it sees or hears (thus the silent mouse). practice a bit before the exam, after 5 minutes or so, you will feel confident enough in the settings to take the exam.

let me know if this (would theoretically) work for you, and any tips you can think of along the way.

1316,: bypassing application/website filters at schoo,"et’s begin with the easiest one: “unapproved” applications. on windows, this is ridiculously easy: simply change the file extension of your app from .exe to .com. .com was the file extension used by ms-dos for its command line applications. on modern windows versions, any .exe file can be renamed to a .com file and still work totally fine. i used this method back in 2017 to run a few desktop pet applications on my school laptop, along with a game boy emulator or two. i think this also works with library computers, but i’m not certain.   
if your school computer has java installed on it, it’s even more laughably easy to bypass app filters: just find a java .jar version of the program you’re trying to use (or another application written in java which performs the same functions as your application). i don’t even think it’s possible to block unknown java apps.    

now for the websites! this one is also pretty easy. there are plenty of school firewall proxy sites out there, but many schools have begun blocking them. however, there’s still another way to bypass it which most schools haven’t blocked yet due to necessity: the wayback machine, and other similar archive sites! obviously you won’t be able to log in to anything or play any multiplayer online games, but it’ll work for simple stuff like regular site browsing (or accessing wikipedia, if your school is one of the asshole schools that decided using wikipedia is cheating).

1319,: how to earn money using email phishing,"here are millions of people every year who fall victim to phishing. and all of those pesky fake addresses almost never get caught. the fcc is just too backed up to deal with it. and if you use a vpn, fake names, purchased cards, all the general hard to track methods people go on about here.

email spam, phishing and the such make up for a collective **$20 billion** every year in losses. that's from people clicking on these links, replying, or calling because they think the email is legit.

first you need a target audience. who is vulnerable to these scams? unfortunately the older generation. these people need a reason to click as well, so try something like selling med supp insurance. you can also try stuff like lost passwords and things like that. you need to be careful however because medical terminology often gets caught in spam filters.

to get the email addresses, you can use a site called [datadicovery](http://datadiscovery.com/). you can ask them for exact data like area codes and ages. it costs money but you gotta spend money to make money right? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

next you need to send all of the email addresses.  not many mass email senders allow for cold email sending but a few do. i would try [mail click convert](http://mailclickconvert.com/) as you can have multiple domains and ips for the inevitable blacklisting. 

just tell them that they need to sign up for medicare stuff with their credit card or have them call you and give them their info. people trust a phone number far more. when people call in with tickets they are always like ""there is a phone number so i trust it""

there is a sucker born every minute and if you reach enough emails you might find on of them. there is a reason people do this still, it's because there is money in it.

1330,": forcibly volunteered? relieve your stress by ""not"" doing your job properly","does your school district enforce compulsory *volunteering policy?*

are you a senior who should complete mandatory *volunteer* hours in order to graduate?

do you have important dates or exams coming up and you are supposed to volunteer?

you aren't being paid for your work, so why should you waste your precious energy for voluntold? actually, the federal law gives you some privileges for volunteering.

the federal **volunteer protection act (vpa)** provides protection to volunteers for nonprofits and government organizations from any harm caused by their acts or omissions on behalf of the organization or entity.

**vpa** applies to:

uncompensated volunteers (volunteers)

volunteers properly licensed, certified, or authorized by state law.

volunteers of nonprofit organizations or governmental entities.

acts within a volunteer’s scope of responsibility.

acts of ordinary negligence.

but excluding:

willful or criminal misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or a conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of the individual(s) harmed by the volunteer.

harm caused by operating a motor vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or other vehicle for which the state requires its operator to possess an operator’s license or maintain insurance.

volunteers for businesses.

the organization or entity utilizing the volunteer.

**in short, you will not be charged for work** ***accidents*** **that happened while you were volunteering.**

if you are supposed to change 100 lightbulbs, just *accidentally* drop all 100 lightbulbs and report you had no intention of doing it. the nonprofits you are volunteering for cannot legally charge you for compensation.

and really, you can just spend entire time using your phone while you are volunteering. since you are not a paid employer, you are not obligated to *work* by hours or any pre-determined workload. as i've previously, mentioned, if you are supposed to change 100 lightbulbs, just change 1 in the last minute and claim you did everything you could do finish your task. *you actually ""volunteered"" and made contribution for your time, so that fully counts as hours.*",UnethicalLifeProTips

1375, save hundreds on your auto insurance policy with this loophole,"okay, i got some gold for you ladies and gentlemen.

basically what you do:

stop paying your auto insurance or pay just a little enough in order to keep coverage active (this can be $10 a month or $0 some months). the insurance provider cannot do anything and it cannot affect your credit. basically what will happen is eventually it will come time to renew auto coverage. once it comes time to renew your coverage the company will offer to forgive the overdue balance so long as you renew coverage. they are doing this due to the pandemic. depending how much your insurance costs this can save you anywhere from $500-$1,000.

some of you might be saying they’ll just cancel my policy. but believe it or not the odds of them doing that are slim, they want to retain you as a customer. and it’s extremely unlikely they cancel your policy if it’s set to renew within a 6 month timeframe.

my friend is also black and the property owner next to his small hotel has an issue with his skin color. he threatened him a few times with horrible racist slurs, called the cops for cooked up allegations (police stopped responding his calls) and now resorted to playing loud, offensive, explicit rap music at loud volumes, which is extremely disturbing to the hotel guests. my friend has already complained and filed grievances but all that did was for the neighbor to no longer play music between 10pm and 8am, however, as soon as legal quiet times are over, music goes on, almost like clock work. no talking or reasoning can get this guy to stop doing what he's doing. so frustrating. lawyers are saying that even legal action would be difficult given that he's not playing loud music at night.

because people's republic of maryland laws say that you have to earn 75 volunteer hours to graduate hs, and i was busy prepping for a dozen aps, sat, act, college app, tutor, etc, i didn't get to finish before my senior year.

despite covid, md doesn't waive or excuse volunteer hours (they say they'd give some virtual volunteering opportunities, but there is only a handful of them), i had to work in some crappy warehouse. the work environment is complete shit and i had to bring my own mask, hand sanitizer, and water, and the company doesn't even give a break time (devilish supervisors patrol in and out the warehouse and nudge anyone who doesn't work for .1 second). so after working 20 hours, i decided to fake it, because why not? others who have coaches as their parents just get hundreds of hours for standing in the field. and typically work to volunteer hours ratio for high-risk, high-intensity labor isn't 1 to 1 in many places.

i just thought ""fuck it"" and faxed my school's volunteer coordinator my paper with hours, but it's taking way too long. and i think they will suspect me for forging hours.

1490, use geico as your insurance company to get out of responsibility for any accidents you cause,"as many lawyers i've consulted have said, you can have irrefutable proof  that the other guy is at fault for the accident but geico will never  pay out without litigation. as the victim of reckless driving you could  go years fighting with lawyers before you ever recoup your options. so!  if you're a reckless driver who wants to circumvent any responsibility  for your actions, geico is your insurance company! they will back you  100% no matter what proof comes up that shows you obviously are at  fault, even if your own words incriminate you in the police report.  
leave  the victim with the choice of having to fight for years with lawsuits  to be made whole again or to just take the major hit to their health,  finances, well being, and overall quality of life and just move on. you  get great odds here, because even though you're at fault, they're  probably too exhausted to fight and you'll never have to face the  consequences of your own actions.  
extra pro tip if the victim has  better insurance, you can get a lawyer, sue the victim, and get paid  $25k without even having to prove that the other person ""ran a red  light."" you won't need any evidence at all to sue the other guy and get  paid, just so long as their insurance company is not geico, you can have  it all!",UnethicalLifeProTips

1531," request: an uninsured driver (who doesn't live here) drove 50 mi to park his car next to mine in my parking lot. he negligently caused his car to spontaneously combust, also totaling my car. how do i get him penalized for having driven w/o insurance, and make him get insured going forward? [ca","ca] 

an uninsured driver (who doesn't live in my community) drove ~50 mi to park his car next to mine, in my community's resident-only parking lot. 

he negligently left a lot of uncapped fluids in his car that spilled and caused his electricals to short circuit, spontaneously combusting his car, which also ended up totaling my car. 

he says the whole ordeal is not his fault because it was an unfortunate accident, even though he is the one who had been driving without insurance (for at least one year at that too, if not for longer, as i recently found out), and negligently left a lot of fluids unattended in the back, and chose to park in my residents-only parking lot instead of the visitor's lot. 

he blames me instead. he won't pay up. he calls me greedy for not taking pity and wanting to be made whole as a result of his fire. but i don't care about that part.

when the fire and police showed up to the fire, he (unknown to me at the time) lied to the police that he had just recently bought the car, and that's why he didn't have insurance on that car. i assume he got off without any tickets.

i only recently found out that he had been driving regularly (the 50+ mi) to my neighborhood for at least the past year, if not more - with the same car and no insurance. so i figure it's kinda too late to call back to the officer and try to get him to ticket him retroactively.

how do i get him penalized for having driven without insurance? i just want him to get fined/ticketed, get a mark on his driving record for having driven w/o insurance for such a long time, and maybe get his driver's license restricted or suspended for the time being until he gets insured. is there a way to make him retroactively provide proof of insurance from 2019-2020?

1588," request: noisy apartment neighbors, but where due to layout of the apartment building i can't do a lot.","hey guys...

so, i absolutely hate my next door neighbors. they play bursts (usually lasting from 30 minutes to an hour) of thumping music at all hours. for example, i was woken up at 5:20am this morning (saturday) because they decided to blast party music for about 30 minutes.

i started a log, and in one weekend we were woken up about 12 times throughout friday, saturday, and sunday night at times ranging from 1:10am to about 6:20am, and everything in between. they don't seem to go to work at all, ever, either. and sometimes it's not even music. i swear they were assuming furniture or something around midnight some days. and vacuuming at 1am.

here's my dilemma. i can't just blast music back or put on 10 hours of nyan cat and leave the apartment. why? the person directly below me has been really nice and i would like to not disrupt their lives. there's nobody above me, thankfully. however, my bedroom wall is shared with their living room, not their bedroom. kind of like this:

[ living room | bedroom][ living room | bedroom][ living room | bedroom]
-------apt 1 door------------------------apt 2 door-----------------------apt 3 door---------------
++++++++++++++++++++++ common hallway+++++++++++++++++++++++++

i am in 1, they are in 2, and other people are in 3. i can't do much if and when they go to sleep because i don't share a wall with their bedroom, only their living room.

things i've tried. talking to them. talking to the community manager. ear plugs. white noise machine. noise cancelling headphones. thumping on my wall to get them to shut up. moving my bed to the other side of the bedroom. sleeping in the living room.

i am about to lose it. not only is it ridiculous that i have to wear earplugs or noise cancelling headphones in my own bedroom, or that i have to sleep on an inflatable mattress in the living room, but the headphones are stupid uncomfortable and the earplugs merely dampen the bass. the music is at a level where my wall shakes.

i also can't call the cops, because they don't play music for extended periods of time. just super loud bursts, scattered throughout the night. 

we have dealt with this for almost 9 months now, and we are at our wit's end. 

whatever suggestions you might have would be greatly appreciated.

1589," request: „friend“ owes me money, how can i get him to pay me"," so this isnt about much money, its more about him thinking that he can trick me which gets me off. (also values slightly changed to make everything a lot easier) so last march we wanted to group gift a friendd a cheap watch, around 10 people had to pay 15$ for that. i bought the present and collected the money from everyone, except that one guy, lets call him alfred. i was pretty sure that alfred owed me money, but when i asked him, he said that he had already paid me. i didnt really believe him, but since i had been going out with him and other friend a few times, i thought that he might have given me the money there and i just forgot about it, so i gave him the benefit of the doubt. 

fast forward a bit and we are doing another group gift. this time it‘s 20$ per person, everyone pays, except him. i ask him to give me the money, he says that hes gonna wire it to me (despite me never giving him my account details, (iban) making it impossible for him to wire me money). nothing ever comes out of it, i ask him one month later, he says that he has wired it to me already (again, he couldnt do that since he doesnt know where to wire it). anyway, i check my accounts, i didnt receive any money, i write him, he makes bs excuses („i cant log into my ebanking rn, ill get to you later“, „yeah ill get a bank statement tomorrow“ and so on and so forth)

now what really pisses me off is that hes betraying a friend for such a small amount of money. he isnt poor, he goes out, he parties, he goes to restaurants frequently. now, how could i bring him to pay me back, preferrably in some emberassing way? or what do you guys think i should do? im pretty sure i wont get the 15$ (the first money), since i have already agreed, that he gave me the money, but im pretty sure that i can get my 20$, just wondering what would be the most unethical way. i was thinking maybe an invoice with horrendous dunning fees? i look forward to you ideas! :)

1716, request: disabled autistic son's kindergarten teacher abused him and she had zero repercussions... story in comments. ideas please.," 

my son is now six but operates at a one-year-old developmental level. he is completely nonverbal, not able to toilet train, and gets overwhelmed and frustrated, so he cries and screams and slams himself when a meltdown occurs. he loved his two years in a special needs preschool, was excited to go every time, and showed slow but notable progress. he started kindergarten and not long after i knew something was wrong. his teacher would say things that were off and sometimes made my skin crawl. he started hating to go, melting down, screaming, slamming, bawling, and flailing in the car, all the way to his room and was terrified for me to leave. it made me sick to have to leave him. i kept saying to my husband, *""you should never feel like your child's kindergarten teacher doesn't like him*."" he started coming home with **weird bruises and abrasions**, which of course he couldn't explain to me since he can't talk. i started photographing them all to document. he had made zero progress all year and had regressed in some areas. finally, in march, i had a terrible feeling one day and just decided to go get him early with no notice. the secretary was on the phone with other lines ringing in and a girl coming in crying for the nurse. busy, she waved,  buzzed me through the doors, and didn't have a chance to call down to the special education room to let them know a parent was coming. i got there and *will never forget.* 

when i walked in, the teacher and all the aides looked like deer in headlights. one ran and opened a door. my son was in there. he was **hyperventilating, had snot smeared all over his face, and vomit down his front**. he saw me, ran, and clung to me, bawling. i said, ""what's going on here?"" the teacher nonchalantly said, ""oh, it's been our strategy for a while now. when he starts throwing tantrums we set him in the 'sensory room' and turn the lights off so he can 'self-calm'."" **they were locking my autistic, bawling, freaked out five-year-old in the dark supply closet by himself.** they all knew that if you snuggle and rock him, you can calm and re-direct him in a matter of about one or two minutes. he gags on anything and for every reason, so if he coughs or cries to hard he vomits; he doesn't understand to aim it somewhere and will easily respirate it. he slams his head around and on the ground; that closet has a cement floor. it turns out the weird bruises were mostly from being **strapped into a chair and trying to escape.** i'll never know what else, how long he spent strapped to chairs trying to pry himself out, how long he was left alone, scared, confused, and covered in snot and vomit in a dark closet. 

i took him home without another word to anyone in the room. i ran, carrying him to the car, and told him he'd never have to go back. we spoke with attorneys but none wanted to take on a school district since we didn't have long-term documentation and police reports. there are federal and district protocols t follow when a child is restrained or put into seclusion, including prior parental knowledge of these possibilities, never leaving a child alone, notifying parents immediately, and filing reports with the school *for every incident.* the only good advice we got was that we should try to work within the district with officials to find a way to give him the safe education he deserves and that it is basically impossible to get a teacher fired. we worked with the special ed coordinator the principal, and a parent to liaison to make a plan for his future. the coordinator was in tears when i told her his story. there were also zero reports filed about these incidents and they had no idea that this was going on.  we have a new teacher, a new department, and a new outlook. he now loves going to school, loves his teacher, is actually making progress, and so many people have commented to me how much he's smiling and learning now.

*that teacher is still there and in charge of other children who can't speak up for themselves and let anyone know if something is happening to them*. she should be in jail. the district said they can't tell me *anything* about if she has a not in her records, if there was anything done, or if she was reprimanded.  she and the aides in that room won't make eye contact with me and are very cold and standoffish as if i don't exist when i see them. i don't know if this is because they are ashamed of it or angry because maybe some shit did roll downhill. i don't care because they are all guilty. there is nothing else i am able to do  within the system*.*

# tldr: my nonverbal, autistic son was locked by himself in a dark supply closet to bawl, vomit, and injure himself for having meltdowns. he was strapped to chairs to either try to force him to do tasks or to get him out of the way. i'll never know how many times, for how long, and how bad it was. i found out, worked with the district to make him anew plan. attorneys said it's pretty impossible to get teachers fired, she still has her job, and my ""hands are tied"".

1719, always check your amazon order history,"quite often amazon or mainly third party sellers will fuck up and parcels you've had delivered will still be pending even though you have received and returns you have sent and been refunded will still be awaiting seller authorisation.


go to orders and check if anything is still in transit or awaiting authorisation, if it is file claim with seller, they usually ignore, then go to amazon to get refund, if you're a prime member they always seem to pay. i've done this for items i've received 3 months ago. 

i do this every month as use amazon quite a lot and usually i get 2/3 items refunded, i got back £50 today.

another tip is if you have any item that is broken and is out of warranty, order the same item from amazon, claim it's broken on arrival and send the broke one back, i've done this for coffee machines, speakers, and most recently a £800 samsungtv that got a black bar running down the middle of the screen.",UnethicalLifeProTips

if you're short on time, you can get just about everything you need by reading only the abstract, introduction and conclusion or discussion sections of the papers you're citing. this allows you to build a ""thoroughly researched"" paper and get a good grade while investing less time. most articles don't start on page 1 of the journal they're published in, so it's not immediately obvious to the reader that you're doing this.

1743,: innovative ways to obscure the line of vision from an intrusive video camera.,": obscuring the lens of a camera mounted and aimed directly at your property.

what can i roll or smear on my neighbor’s window to obscure his dumb camera?

i live in a resort area year on a quiet, dead end marsh side road year round with my wife in nh on the seacoast. we are the only ones who do reside all year long. our other neighbors (10 additional homes), are seasonal. they go back to their respective residences or snowbird it. the neighbor directly across the street has in his cottage kitchen window, a camera on the inside ledge, pointing directly at us. this came to be after years and years of close knit living. we all know each other,and i am the year round gatekeeper ,if you will. following a major disagreement last year, aforementioned neighbor decided to spitefully placed a camera on his kitchen sink sill, directly pointed at us. it’s been awkward, to say the least. keep in mind folks,my hat he is in a seasonal cottage. our home is a majestic 3 story beautiful home with grass and always meticulous. his place is tiny and has gravel (some opt for gravel here because of salt water high tides). my point? there’s nobody nor no conceivable reason for a camera to be fixed on any property here, as we do not have through traffic, along with the obvious fact that we are completely at the end of the dead end road. the only place to go past his home...is into the marsh or the ocean high tide. additionally, he just left for florida until april. everyone else has left as well. yet, the guy kept the camera fixed directly at us and our property. we sit out on the front farmers porch almost nightly watching the sunset, enjoying out firepit,dining, etc. we feel like this clown’s eyes are always on us, day or night. the window where the camera sits is only 6 feet up from the ground. there is a blind spot that is the corner of his house, where there is no fence. it abuts the marsh grass, seamlessly. one at night could easily walk around to side of the house front and be only inches from the window. in essence, a hand could be raised in front of the window and it would be perfectly in front of the camera lens, which is obviously on the opposite side of the glass. my non stupid question is: what can i strategically apply to his outside window pane to effectively obscure a clear vision of us and our home. my intent is not to deface nor irreparably harm his glass, but instead, just to...block his ability to watch us non stop, from his laptop down in florida. perhaps something organic that would not be exactly in the vein of malice, yet may also be inconclusive as to how it got there? i thought about perhaps coming up from below at night and quickly using an extended handle paint roller smeared with vaseline and just...smudging the general spot where the camera aims through. we do have a lot of seagulls who are always effective at dropping deuces on our vehicles, yet how to collect it and slinging it onto the target spot of the windowpane seems ludicrous. i welcome any suggestions that will not result in damage or criminal charges, but simply to get us peace of mind.

alright, so this may be a little on the scummy side but hear me out. amazon has a limit on the amazon of shut you can return before they eventually ban you right? now i believe i found a way around it... most sellers on amazon give you a warranty card saying “contact if anything is wrong” it is usually an email so just email them with the order number and make up some bullshit excuse. “you received an empty box” or “you received a box stuffed with packing material”. hell if it’s a battery-powered thing then say it blew up... and don't forget to say you disposed of it immediately cause well it exploded! what are they going to do, ask you to return a discarded exploded electronically? now yeah this is directly hurting the seller and i do not recommend it, but if you not doing well financially then every penny counts.

i applied for a government job and was offered the position contingent on a background check. i didn't think anything of it because i have no criminal history or anything to hide. well, it turns out they called one of my former employers (let's call her karen), just to confirm that i really worked for her, and she completely trashed me. when i spoke to the background check company (applicant insight) i asked why they included the negative things karen said when their only job was to verify employment dates and they said they are ""obligated to report everything that is said."" i specifically didn't list karen as a reference because we ended on bad terms (i trained her animals and she refused to get veterinary treatment for one so i quit) but i couldn't leave the position off my resume because i was there for several years. her slander cost me the job. i have started the dispute process with applicant insight but they said all they can really do is call karen again and recheck the info she gave unless there is a different employee from there who can confirm my claims. sadly, i didn't have any coworkers who weren't four-legged so i'm considering getting a burner phone, using a fake name and pretending to be a ""manager"" there to dispute her claims. i have no idea if that would work or if they would check to see if the fake person actually exists. thoughts? also, i already called a lawyer and they said that since there's no concrete evidence to support my claim, they can't help me. i'm incredibly upset and frustrated. if anyone has any other ideas i'd love to hear them.

1812," request: my ex boss did me wrong, what can i do with their instagtam accounts without having the password","hi everyone, 

as the title reads, my ex boss (during my whole time with them) was a asshole and always took advantage of us. it was very difficult to quit as it was my first job in the country i'm now, but that does not make it okay to take advantage ok your employees. 

many times they wouldn't pay us the actual hours we had worked but the time they considered was enough to do a certain task (without them ever even trying to do those tasks) and lastly, he laid me off (and two other people on a team of 7) in the middle of covid, without seeing any reduction in sales or their business being affected in any way as we are mostly online. all this without any severance pay. they simply said we had to close for a couple weeks during the pandemic and then simply never called me back. i even left stuff there at the office (probably food, snacks, water bottle, a scarf) as i thought we were going to be called back at some point.  (just fyi, this is not in the usa)

as of now i have another job, better pay and i'm overall happy, but i would like to affect my previous employer in some way. as i used to managed them, i have access to their instagram accounts, that over my year there, increased their followers a lot, from being an almost ignored account (around 300 followers) to over 6000, and i was not adequately paid for those hours of work, as he didn't wanted me to use my regular day hours on instagram, but wouldn't pay me the extra time, however would say that instagram was extremelu important for their sales (it really was) and had to be taken care of. 

i unfortunately do not have the passwords anymore (i left them on my notebook at the office,  confident that they would call me back once the pandemic was over, but as mentioned before, they ghosted me.) the accounts are simply open on my phone so since i don't have the passwords i cannot delete the two accounts, and manually blocking each follower seems like a lot of work.

i also don't want to post something that might make it obvious that someone is fucking with their account and just cause them to chance the password making me unable to do anything. it has to be done in silence, fast and irreversible.

1875,": employee nests, tips on keeping them from being discovered....","employee nests are places where employees go hide, eat, sleep, rest/relax, watch tv/smartphone, etc. etc. in their workplace.

never ever leave anything behind in your nest for managers or security to later find. set them up and then break them down when you are finished. hide your nesting stuff in different spots if you can. that way if one item is found it will just be an odd thing. it wont be a nesting ensemble that will give away that someone is using them all to nest somewhere.  above drop ceiling tiles is, imo the best place. carry them in if you can. i've used a large lunch cooler to bring things in. 

i've also used motion detecting door-alerts to let me know when someone is coming. if you have a setup in a place someone approaching might discover before you can put them away.... head the person off and distract him. get between them and your nest. make an excuse to get them out of there so you can hurry and hide your nesting materials. 

i've worked a lot of places (where i had unlimited access) and can usually tell a space has been a employee nest. biggest giveaway (duh) is a lone chair in a hidden area. don't leave a chair! better to put down something and sit on it. something you can then put away (hide) after you are done. a folding chair is ok if you can hide it well.

crying bouts without a pacifier averaged about 20 minutes. with a pacifier, 5.

before you respond:

(1) no, it's not a choking or sids hazard. in fact, a pacifier has been shown to be one of the few things that reduces the incidence of sids. also, (decent) pacifiers are built with air holes around the front sides in case your little one vomits while sucking. as long as he can cough, you're not risking anything worse than what was already going to happen.

(2) obviously, be gentle when removing the adhesive. you should also test adhesives on a relatively hairless part of your body before putting them on a baby, no matter where they go.

(3) babies don't have great memories. by the time he's reached the age where a pacifier is contraindicated, his memory span will be at most two weeks. so, no, it's probably not going to affect his personality negatively.

1916,: how to help yourself during examity/proctoru based exams," 

i did this for a course that had absolutely nothing to do with my major just had to pass and graduate and taking the class at home further made me hate that i had to give any effort towards it. (got a b-)

this class required lots of memorization on what different terminology meant, stuff ive never used before neither will i have to anytime in my life. i was forced to take it as it was the only available option online in order for me to graduate that semester.

  
this is the way i successfully pulled it off (final exam proctor was a little suspicious)

keep a tall lamp next to you this way the overhead light casts a shadow over your eyes making you eye movement harder to see  
wear thick framed glasses so that further blocks their view of your eyes

its mainly useful for mc heavy exams that way you dont need to use your keyboard

keep a tablet/ipad on your keyboard and make sure your constantly sitting at an angle thats kinda hunched over/face close to the screen this way it isnt as obvious that youre staring at the keyboard and is just your natural position  
when asked to show your surroundings  lift the laptop up and use your thumbs to hold the ipad  in place that way they see the whole room/table thats empty

if questioned as to why youre ""constantly looking down"" just say youre trying to think or something, and offer to show the area again, this worked well for me as the proctor would simply go nono its fine carry on

ofcourse make sure every sound is off on the tablet, put tape on the speakers incase you nudge the buttons or something

if you know a site thatll have most of your answers (chegg/coursehero.....etc) keep them open before hand, the less you have to move your fingers/hands the better

because you can be a jerk without saying anything quotable and contemptible, therefore you can make them look like the jerk.

because it makes you more alert in case someone tries to steal something from you or tries something physical.

because if there's a time when you're too intoxicated to speak and not say anything stupid, or they're too intoxicated to understand anything that you say, it's probably while they are confronting you.

because if they have a plan to ask you a series of questions to figure out how to tell you high stakes lies, in the worst of all possible cases it involves confronting you.

because you want your ally to take the risk of saying something stupid for you.

because it's your boss who confronts you a lot that's confronting you, and you're saving it to aftermeet with your peers anyway, and you don't want to commit to anything before you've decided at the after meet what to say.

because when you're confronted, the most reliable means of not getting fired on the basis that you exploded is being silent.

because it's your way of being cool under fire.

because they're talking about suffering, and you're too callous to pay attention to it.

because being not silent during the confrontation is or makes a personal commitment, and you're bad at keeping personal commitments.

however, there's a karen. attractive and angered, white settlement is enamored to her thin and forceable form, and she prefers to interpret ""live, laugh, love"" her own way. she has a lawyer, a tae-bo tape, a dozen ever - replaced subordinates at her day job, connections with groups of hella sketch jobless people, and her military uniform is a cocktail party dress. intelligence reveals that to her allies, which are not you, she says that she wants something involuntary to happen to her, something that you really don't want to get caught doing. therefore, don't do it. forbid your subordinates from doing it, and don't even allow talk about it. be clear what you're forbidden, and don't go into details about it. when someone does it, fire them. however, that doesn't mean you have to take unkind and effective measures to prevent it.",UnethicalLifeProTips

1987,": attend all your google meets on autopilot with meetninja! flawlessly handles multiple scheduled meets, disables your camera &amp; microphone in-meet, and even works in the background or with the display off — all at the click (double-click) of a button!","**meetninja on github**](https://github.com/shur1k-n/meetninja-google-meet-bot)

# features

* mulitple meet sessions supported, according to the user-defined meet schedule
* works even with the display on sleep (and does not wake it up either)
* works even in the background while you do other work (as long as you do not *explicitly* ""minimize"" the chrome window meetninja generates; just keep it open in the background, beneath your current open window(s))
* automatically disables camera &amp; microphone in-meet
* color-coded &amp; concise activity logging (verbose) with timestamps of all activities

# usage

1. clone / download this repository or its content (mainly **meetninja.py** and **chromedriver.exe**)
2. pip-install all the packages mentioned under the ""dependencies"" subheading
3. do not run meetninja.py just yet. first, open it using any editor, and substitute your inputs (google meet urls, their start times, duration of all meets, google username, and password) into the dummy values in the top section of the code ([visit the github page to view images](https://github.com/shur1k-n/meetninja-google-meet-bot))
4. save your changes, and run the program (either by double-clicking meetninja.py, or executing it via a terminal window if you are feeling particularly geeky today)
5. take the chillest of pills (figuratively) and abandon all your worries; meetninja's got your back

# what meetninja does

upon execution, meetninja generates a new google chrome window in developer mode, and this new window stays idle until it is time to join your first meet (according to your schedule). once it is time, meetninja automatically logs you into your google account, navigates to the first meet url, disables your camera &amp; microphone, joins the meet session, and then waits until the duration specified (60 minutes by default) before ending the call and repeating the same for the *next* meet session (whenever it may be) and so on, until your schedule has exhausted *(phew)* — all this with just a single (double) click!

# tip(s) for cyberjedi-like usage

**wake-on-lan:**

you may use meetninja paired with wake-on-lan / magic packet (if your motherboard and network adapter support it) for the optimal, ultimate ""away from keyboard"" automation experience.

you would be surprised by how common a feature wol is in most modern *and* semi-modern systems. hence, definitely *do* check it out. it is super cool, convenient, easy, helpful, and—importantly—native.

i highly recommend [**this android app**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.uk.mrwebb.wakeonlan) (ad-free, free, light, simple) for sending wol packets to your computer system over the air and triggering a wake-up from the hibernation / sleep state without even touching the system (ironic how you would wake your system up so you could sleep, hah!).

**chrome remote desktop / microsoft's rd client:**

you may also need or use the above remote desktop client(s) if you need to mid-sleep-check on your progress or if your computer system has a login password you may need to enter remotely after a wake-on-lan.

# note

1. make sure you do not close the generated chrome window until all your meets are attended
2. make sure you do not input the start time with leading zeros like `08 30` (eight thirty am). the correct format is simply `8 30`. this, however, does not apply to zero by itself, so `8 0` (eight am) would work just fine
3. you may abort the process at any stage or time by pressing ctrl + c from within the meetninja console / terminal window

# dependencies to pip-install

* **selenium** (for chrome-based automation)
* **datetime** (for scheduling &amp; timestamps)
* **pause** (for scheduling)
* **colorama** (for colors)
* **termcolor** (for colors)

i have someone remoting into my work desktop using software so they can control the keyboard/mouse output on my pc. meanwhile, my laptop is hooked up to my work monitor so my mouse isn’t just randomly floating around or cursor typing by itself while i’m “working” and the boss comes by.  i’m still able to stand there and be present at work surfing the internet or whatever interests me while someone else does the boring stuff.

the it guy has told me the company utilizes a firewall so website history can be tracked etc.. i’m not worried about this as i have access to other wifi connections that aren’t work related. my concern is more that they are tracking incoming connections to the work pc and are able to track incoming ips. how do we outsmart it and remote the computer on the firewalled connection without them being able to see incoming ips? i could have my remote worker connect using a non-work network but it would still need to connect to the work desktop as there is specific software needed on there.

i realize this is a fringe/edge case and may not exist but is there software/hardware for your computer to control mouse/keyboard on another pc by replicating their existence rather than a remote connection ?  could essentially have the remote worker connect to my laptop (non-work network) which will connect to my work pc to replicate a keyboard/mouse if this exists.

now, the thing is do want tips on this and how to do it and try to not get myself in bigger problems, but also i'm thinking if this is going way too far. i think playing around with him that way using pictures of a cam girl is funny and kind of shitty, but harmless at a degree where he would forget about me in a couple of weeks if i ever reveal him the truth or stop talking to him. but taking money from him, using pictures from another person is maybe too unethical and illegal.

i have a scheduled appointment with i.t. support to fix the issue via microsoft teams, where i will share my screen and give the agent control of my computer. based on other coworkers' experiences, its an easy fix for i.t. and quite common for new at home employees. i would like to make my internet look unstable once it has to use the call application. 

apparently many employees work strictly on chat due to connection issues at home and i don’t think just saying my internet is slow will cut it for them. currently i am considering unplugging my router once i see he signs onto the system, or launching an ip stress on a different device next to me. 

the goal is for the agent to think the system itself triggers my internet to become crappy or cuts it completely and that my internet is not good enough for a call, but fine for livechat.

complicating matters is that the guy is fairly ingrained with the local police as it turns out many of them think alike. imagine your typical chest thumping trump supporter. racists in hiding types.

i have thought of the obvious which is to wait until the trailer is moved and take away his only legal parking space and to return the favor by buy some junkers and parking them in front of his house in one of those ""legal spots"". according to the officers, you can have anything you want on a car (vulgarity, obscene pictures, etc.) and they can do nothing about it.

wanted to check in with the experts and see if there is anything else that could be done to make his life a living hell. this sub never fails to disappoint. he has a camera system outside his house thst would limit any vandalism and plus, he would more than likely know it is me. i'm looking for a more under the radar approach.

the landlord doesn't want to change it because the noise seems normal to her and it still runs but said she'll change it only if the machine breaks down completely.

apparently the fact that the shock absorbers are dead and it sounds like i have bricks in it, the smell that sometimes comes out after washing or that i feel like clothes are not washed properly is not a good reason to change it.

keep in mind: during deferment, interest still accrues but it was going to be accruing anyway.  

also, once you pay down, your minimum payment will be reduced...take the amount that it reduced (all credit cards combined) and keep applying it to the balance of one of the cards until it is paid off.  rinse and repeat but at least you got a head start.  

don’t be afraid to ask for it to be deferred longer if possible and good luck paying down your debt.",UnethicalLifeProTips

2103,": when you already know the product you want, ask sales staff about the customer they want.","a lot of sales jobs have odd incentivization structures which encourage sales staff to prioritize certain types of customer over others. this is particularly true of larger companies that are pushing to increase their market share for particular demographics. rather than getting upset that your loyalty/complacency isn't being rewarded, try being proactive in fitting yourself into a prioritized demographic and fucking over the shareholders who make purchasing decisions based on the false market saturation data you will be contributing to.

 it isn't difficult to fit yourself into their incentive boxes and this can allow them to offer you better deals. in a lot of cases the amount you save for being a ""business"" customer is greater than the cost of registering a business. if it is a subscription service that is pushing staff to prioritize new customers over existing customers you might save money by cancelling a service and starting a new one rather than renewing an existing service. it is sometimes even worth signing up your phone or utilities with a competitor for a month long contract and then immediately breaking the contract and wearing the early cancelation cost just to take advantage of an offer that is only available to customers of competitors. is there a special offer that is only available to people who live in a certain area? check what evidence they need to classify you as living in that area. it might be as simple as mailing yourself a letter to your friend's address in that area. 

in addition to helping you secure the best possible deal, this helps sales staff to meet their sometimes unrealistic employee performance indicators. if it is close to the end of the month and they need just one more of a particular type of customer and you are prepared to shoehorn yourself into that demographic, they might be willing to sacrifice their commission on the sale just to hit target and unlock other incentives. 

while it can involve a bit of mucking around to access the special offer, you can save thousands of dollars, the staff member looks good for hitting the target demographic, the manager looks good for successfully implementing a focus on target demographics. the higher ups can feel special because their ridiculous incentivization scheme appears on paper to have increased their saturation of key market sectors.",UnethicalLifeProTips

2106,: in a state with eviction protection? don’t pay rent - and make a lot of money.,"a few friends just did this in california.

if you’re in a state with eviction protection - and you’re still working - don’t pay your rent for as long as you can (here in ca, until feb 2021). keep it in some sort of savings account. landlords are so desperate to recoup money from those unable to pay rent they are willing to make a deal. 

one of a few things will happen:

-	you might get a letter from the landlord attorney to waive your whole balance if you agree to move. no hit on your record. you can take all your money and move somewhere else. you can rinse and repeat. this is flawed because during landlord verification they will reveal that you were unable to pay, and you won’t get the new place. 
-	you can wait until close to the end of eviction protection (not too close) and ask the landlord to pay half your balance and be done with it. if they agree, you just got half of all those months in free rent and lots of money saved. this is what my friends did. they suddenly have over 10k saved. 
-	if none of this works - hey, just pay off your balance that you saved and no harm no foul.",UnethicalLifeProTips

2114,r. help. electric company have told us they will cut our electricity on monday due to a giant euro bill which is mathematically impossible. is there anyone who could suggest what we can do,"after moving into a flat in portugal we were paying an estimated bill of e80 a month.

no one came to check the meter for the 1st four months due to covid, and when they did we were given a bill of e550 on top of the 80/month we'd already paid.

(i should have entered the correct figures on their website but couldn't work it out as it blocks google's translate plugin).

now our accurate bills are consistently around 60e/month and we are using far more energy. for the 1st month no-one lived there as i was moving furniture in. the next 1.5 months only two people lived there. now there are 4 of us.

our electricity usage during those 1st four months was at least half what we use now yet edp claim it was around e217/month. they've offered to send someone to check the meter although if they don't find a fault they will bill us and extra 95 euros, and it seems to be functioning correctly now as the bills seem reasonable and consistent with what we're using.

they have a reading from when the last tenant moved out and a matching one from when they turned the power back on, so aren't considering that it could have been the previous occupier, although i'm not sure who provided those readings and whether they were done in person or sent in.

i've run the maths on the electrical draw of all the items in our flat and even leaving them all on 24/7 its simply not possible to use that much power. the landlord did send in builders to change the built in shower, but they can't have used 600 or 700 euros of electricity in 3 or 4 days.

2135,: want a product on ebay for cheaper? make your own listing that significantly undercuts the current sellers and watch their prices fall.,"online marketplaces have very little barriers of entry so prices are very reactive. unfortunately, sellers often operate under an unspoken agreement to not undercut each other because if they get into a price war they all lose out.
so why not give the free market a little nudge and test the limits to see how low of a margin these store will actually accept?


to pull it off properly though you need to appear as a significant threat to the current sellers. making a listing with lots of stock and boting views should do the trick. also you shouldn’t have the listing up for long so you don’t run the risk of attracting real customers. if people happen to purchase your product, make sure to quickly refund them as to not get bystanders caught in your little scheme. this should often remove any obligation to pay ebay fees as well but double check the policy for your region.


if you pull it off properly and the sellers have enough margin to cut, you should see prices falling significantly within 1-24 hours. last but not least, this will get the best results for items that are being price gauged like limited stock preorders or products in demand due to covid because sellers have a lot of leeway with their pricing.",UnethicalLifeProTips

due to covid, our boss’s (a) boss , f, has decided that no more than one full-time employee can be working at the same time. for the life of me, i don’t know why.

so the warehouse full-timer, e, has been furloughed. but that job still needs to be done. so my sister, g, a part-time employee, is now working full-time hours and being given all the same responsibilities of e by f. all while g is still getting paid a part-time rate.

i’m angry on my sisters behalf because it’s clearly taxing her mentally and physically beyond what she signed up for. there is ample room for malicious compliance here, but that would be asking g and a to take risks that, despite my gentle pressing, they aren’t willing to take. so sadly, it’s off the table.

2161, person pretending to be someone else on tinder wants to meet in person (catfish situation). what’s the best way to give them what they deserve,"obligatory: english isn’t my first language and i’m on mobile 

basically i saw this girl’s tinder profile a couple of days ago and she had her instagram on her bio so i texted her on ig instead. she asked how i got her @ and i told her tinder. we talked a little about our age and where we’re from, and then she asked if we could meet up. the thing is, she doesn’t even know what i look like cuz i don’t have pictures of myself on my instagram account. 

i felt like something was off so i took her photos and did a reverse search on google, which led to the instagram page of the actual girl. now that wasn’t enough proof that she was lying about who she is; many of us have multiple accounts. she also told me she was in my country as a tourist, so i looked through her profile to find proof that she was actually in this country the past two weeks (our country has a strict quarantine policy. if you enter, you have to be quarantined, which means that she has at least been here for two weeks). i couldn’t find any proof that she was actually here, but i did find her facebook page. there was a post that showed that 13 days ago, she was in a different country (she posted picture of herself buying a fridge and tagged the location. fridge also had instructions in some other language) so i’m sure that she is lying about who she is. she wants to meet up in 3 hours and honestly i have no idea who is going to show up. i have no idea how she’s going to pull this off cuz obviously, she’s not who she says she is, which i will know when we meet. anyway, what’s something i can do to get back at her?

for example: claire's husband dean works during the hours that the service line for generic government assistance/vacation rental platform/financial institution/whatever and so he's been unable to have his address updated since it has to be done over the phone for some reason

if claire calls, gives all the correct information, but says she's dean's wife and he's not available, then likely they will have to tell her to have him call. some places will then let dean set claire as a point of contact for the future, but dean would still have to call in and approve that first.

however, if claire calls, gives all the correct information, and says she's dean then the agent on isn't allowed to question her based on her voice since that would be discrimination. if you do get push back the agent is in the wrong.

just a slight note, this is in reference canada and us based agencies so not sure how well this translates if you're calling from other countries. additionally, some brands may have additional verification measures so be sure to educate yourself on what information, account, or device you may need access to in order to fully authenticate",UnethicalLifeProTips

**more info:** i have a 2000 e-350 box truck that i just purchased for $3,000 and had plans on converting it into a camper to take across the country, as i am a college student taking a semester off. however, i have already spent over an additional $1,000 on it to fix a ball joint, remove interior rust, and fix the windshield wipers (the two latter jobs i even did myself just to save money). i have spent a little over $5,000 total but a lot of that is on parts that i can reuse in future projects, such as an angle grinder, lumber, etc.

the big issue is that there is engine oil leaking into the coolant system somewhere. i tested some possible faults but i am not fairly sure it's a head gasket leak, which is a major issue that will need to be addressed somewhere down the road and will likely cost thousands to repair. i am flushing the coolant system constantly so if someone comes to look at the vehicle the coolant reservoir should \[hopefully\] not look too oily.

at this point i need to sell it and cut my losses, but hopefully my losses will be minimal to none. i am planning on detailing the interior and exterior, and paneling the walls/floor/ceiling of the box truck interior with thin plywood to hide any scratches/dents in the box and to make it generally look good. 

i plan on detailing it inside and out (which will cost me a couple hundred more dollars so hopefully it will be worth the money and effort), and also listing it on local marketplaces with professional quality photos and an enticing description. i also plan to be as responsive and helpful as possible to potential buyers because many people on these marketplaces are frankly rude, especially when it comes to answering basic questions (as if they don't even want to sell their vehicles). 

**my question to you:** **are there any tricks to selling a vehicle for a higher price than it may be worth?** i know i can get more money from a private buyer than a dealership, and i am not proud of passing on my ""problem"" vehicle to the next unsuspecting buyer, but i am a self-supported student and cannot afford to lose nearly half of my savings that i have invested into the problematic work van.",UnethicalLifeProTips

2317,: 3 simple ways to fill in gaps in your resume.,"et’s face it. employers are unnecessarily, cynical cunts about gaps in your resume, even now with all that’s going on. here’s three unethical, awesome tips:

1. do you like to travel? have you ever left your home for any reason? cool. it doesn’t matter how long ago it was, or where you went.* regale your tales of adventure and learning about the world which better helps you understand the position you’re applying for. what are they gonna accuse you of?  *not going to niagara falls?* *ever?!* of course not. traveling is cool. just have the details ready if they ask and be aware of having to answer covid related questions. 

do your homework before you claim you went somewhere that’s on lockdown. have you ever been camping at any point in your life? cool. we’re you recently homeless? nope. you were camping. camping is a solid filler because it removes most covid related questions about traveling and social distancing and makes you look responsible, yet adventurous. it could be a few days, or months of traveling and camping. again, just make sure you have the details ready if someone asks. 

2. “family illness” is always a solid go-to, especially now. almost no one will expect you to answer detailed questions about this.  you’ll also probably gain some brownie points for being selfless and caring about your loved ones. you *will* run into covid questions though, so all you have to say is it wasn’t covid related. period. 

it could be a relative, or a friend, or you! everyone is family! you don’t have to voluntarily disclose who it was. you can, but there’s no immediate benefit by doing that. say it with me now:  “*it’s too painful to talk about*”. did someone you ever know get sick? like ever? cool. just say it happened recently. it takes a seriously out-of-touch, insensitive prick, or just a cruel asshole of a boss, to ask for specific details about something so personal. 

**bonus**: this is a good way to weed out bad companies/bosses. you don’t want to work there if they get too personal in an interview anyway. 

3. this next one has *tons* of grey area. that’s why it’s my favorite gap filler. turn your hobbies into “i’m an entrepreneur!” 

everyone loves and wants to be an entrepreneur. just say you tried to start a business that revolves around one of your hobbies. it could have been started years ago, (and still ongoing) or just before you lost/quit your last job. 

you know *a lot* of stuff about your hobby and you’ve probably even thought about doing it professionally. focus on the positives, but throw in a few negatives, aka “lessons learned” to make it sound like you’re all growns up now, and you’re more passionate about blah, blah, blah position. again, what are they going say? *you didn’t try to start a business?* 

there’s almost no way to prove this didn’t happen as long as you say you were a one man operation, *but* just maybe, you were also interviewing potential employees, or perhaps flirting with investors? no one can really prove, or disprove it unless they go to great, improbable lengths. keep it mostly in the past so your potential new employer doesn’t think you’re going to quit soon. 

plus this looks like you have initiative, heart and a willingness to thrive!  this also gives you a way to turn the conversation from boring, uncomfortable “work talk” into something you actually like talking about. you’ll come across as knowledgeable, honest and passionate. three desirable attributes important to any job.",UnethicalLifeProTips

(that won't lead back to me),"my(21) gf(22) got a new housemate (b) that was forced onto her bc the old housemate moved out and said she would stop looking for a replacement if they didn't accept her. this person turned out to be a victim mentality and very agressive person. she also happened to be a ~30 year old, out of college while my gf is still a student. my gf is an international student and is soft spoken and would cry after every interaction with b because b took control of the conversation and treated my gf like a child. b would claim disrespect if my gf didn't treat her like a superior probably bc of age. she was a total bitch from the start. first conversation i heard was her asking my gf if she works, "" oh your parents pay for everything? i thought so. well i work, i provide for myself...blah blah"". very egocentric and full of excuses. hasn't paid rent for the months she has been there and will likely come out of deposit which will cost my gf. 

it may not sound terrible here but basically after a month, my gf was having mental breakdowns from the emotional abuse and moved into my place for 3 months despite paying rent there and would often cry just from the texts. in the housemate group chats b would come across as nice and make my gf look like the bad one (only gf and b were living there during this time). my gf never defends herself bc she saw it as pointless. she would still cry and despite me telling her to defend herself from all these lies, she wouldn't. i grew to hate this person and idk how my gf could take all of this and sit quietly. i assume bc she is a foreigner and is trying to avoid any issues. i wish it was me just so i could tell this bitch off. 

there's more to this but idk how to express myself the best and i hope you get the jist that this person is toxic. long story short, she's a terrible person and i have her number and i would like to make her life more miserable. anything helps. could i be the bigger person? sure, but she made my gf suffer and dragged and still is dragging her name through the mud and i'm mad i can't and my gf won't do anything about it.",UnethicalLifeProTips

the meat that i won't get into is that we signed with the worst agent known to fucking man. he has repeatedly shirked his responsibilities as our agent, and honestly, i now hate him with a seething passion.

the situation has blown up and just totally devolved. he will only allow us to cancel our agreement if we agree to pay him 3% of a home we buy before the contract end date in dec, or have our new agent give him 25% of their fee. i read over the contract again, and (i have no idea how i let this happen) we don't have a) an exit clause, or b) anything laid out for breach of contract on his side.

this man will not see one cent from me. i swear to god i will not allow that to happen. i would choose to just not buy a house rather than let him benefit from the magnitude of bullshit he's pulled on us the last few weeks. 

my question, though, is even though things are now openly hostile, what if i don't cancel?

like, if i don't cancel, how can i make his life a living hell as a client so he will cancel? if he cancels, we don't owe a thing.

i was thinking maybe we could have him go take videos of every home that hits the market, but so very little hits right now that he's going to see them for other clients anyway.

let's use a 2000s mercedes g wagen for example. they go for about $25k. we're going to get you in this car for $10,000 or less.

here's how you do it.

.

first step is to pick your top 5 choices of car. offer the $10,000 and say the offer only lasts for a day.

now let's get to work. use the free email generator to sign up for hundreds of accounts. use all of these accounts to post 2000s mercedes g wagens for a $7k or 6k. this will do 2 thing. 1. it will make the people selling theirs for $25k lower their prices in order to compete. 2. it will allow you to capture and lock down every buyer out there. if they think they're getting the g wagen for such a good deal, they'll stop looking.

next step is to spam all the sellers with cheap offers like $3k, $4k super low numbers. this is making your $10k look very good now. and because all the potential buyers are currently responding to your fake posts, the only offers they will be getting are your extreme lowballs.

extra tip for those wh join r/illegalmoneyprotips : give them a couple $23k or $22k offers as well. then flake hard. go ghost. now, if they ever did get a serious offer, they probably wouldn't even respond to it because they'd expect them to flake like the last 10 people.

last step is to offer your $10k. comparing that $10k to the $3k or $4k they are being offered regularly, the $10k will look beautiful. they will take it instantly and you will have a $25k car for $10k.

congrats. sorry for saying join r/illegalmoneyprotips so much i just think it could be a great community. if you think this is too much work to do, check impt for a method that gets people to do it for you. also it's easier if people do it together so vote on r/impt for a car you like and we will work together to get them for cheap.",UnethicalLifeProTips

with the vpn on and you signed in go to ""microsoft store"" -&gt; ""redeem a code""

if all goes well it should be redeemed to your account.

next go to your xbox and sign in
go to settings -&gt; account -&gt; payment and billing -&gt; order history

the code redemption should show up as the most recent order. click on the game and then ""view in store"" 

from there you should be able to install it to your console!

optional/maybe necessary steps

if it is unable to install but the code was redeemed you may need to go to xbox settings -&gt; system -&gt; language &amp; region and from there change the region to the united states.",UnethicalLifeProTips

now, i left on friday night to stay at my folks place and i saw this dude hanging out and drinking with his other buddies. one of his friends is supposedly moving into my room. he knocks and asks to be shown around, i let his friend in. the guy opened my closet and drawers to check how much space they have, bit odd but i let it slide. anyways, i lock my room and exit the flat. 

saturday night i came back to my flat to pick some stuff and the room looks a bit disturbed. the washroom is a shit show and looks like somebody has slept in my room. turns out these guys used the other entrance of my room, the one which wasn’t locked but still bolted and they opened and used my room. i had a verbal spat with my flatmate, his friend probably wanted to “feel” how he’d sleep here. my flatmate said, “well i’m saying sorry what are you being so angry for”. 

i’m too nice of a guy to do something about it so my girlfriend is writing this post cause she’s furious.

he has a  couple of psilocybin mushrooms sitting in a jar on the top shelf of his  closet. he's working on trying to move soon, and i understand possession  of psilocybin, a schedule i controlled substance, is a third-degree felony. maximum penalty for adults is incarceration for five years and a  permanent black mark on your record which will make it virtually  impossible to get a good job, live in a good house, or live a normal  life. i hate cheaters. i also caught him last week hitting my dog when i  was in the bathroom brushing my teeth after he lost a game in cod on  his ps4, so i completely lost all respect for him, don't even know why  he was comfortable openly bragging about how he cheated on my best  friend either, weirdo.

what would i  need to do to get him arrested? would calling 9-1-1 and explaining that  my roommate has magic mushrooms in his closet be enough, or should i  make a story up how we were walking and he was going to sell them to me?  i have thought about taking his phone at night and texting myself from  it, with me replying to him while he was asleep and faking a conversation of him claiming he was going to sell them to me. do i not need to do  that for him to get arrested, or is possession truly enough? i'm female,  and i have also thought about adding in hitting myself to where my face  is bruised and lie to the police claiming he did it because he was  going to force me to eat the mushrooms and threaten me to kill me if i  didn't, maybe that's too far, lol, i just want him to suffer.

the 1st actual reading came after the 3rd month and showed an impossible jump from the reading they had. electric bills since then are always around $50/month.

this has already become a drama and the elec company are digging their heels in demanding its accurate. it seems certain to turn into a long drawn out court battle.

if the meter looked upon close inspection, but not immediately, to have been tampered with or installed incorrectly the drama would be instantly ended and they'd accept an estimation based on subsequent bills. the flat was refurbed and many contractors had access so no-one will be on the hook.

the immediate thought was neodymium magnets. the meter is cased in glass with aluminum dials and magnets are only slightly interested in it. probably its designed to ignore magnetic interference.

2443,": you can block most, if not all advertisements on your android apps by utilising the private dns function in your device.","i'll be using adguard dns as a primary example for doing this. adguard is a popular ad-blocking tool that is available across platforms. all of your data packet queries are sent to the particular dns and it will filter out any or all the ads *(listed in their host files)* and popups from the web site. this is similar to what's performed with adguard extensions on your pc's chrome browser.

#it's a one-time setup.

the biggest advantage of using this feature is that you get rootless systemwide ad-blocking on your android device. unfortunately, you cannot change hosts files, meaning you can not specify the urls which you want to block.

#directions:

* make sure your device is running android 9.0 pie or later.
* now, go to settings &gt; network &amp; internet settings &gt; private dns.
* for samsung galaxy devices go to settings &gt; connections &gt; more connection settings &gt; private dns
* or simply search private dns from settings search bar.

**(a) for adguard dns: (general):**

dns.adguard.com

**(b) for adguard dns: (family protection - sfw content):**

dns-family.adguard.com

**(c) blah dns: (alternative hobby project):**

dot-de.blahdns.com

***hit save, and enjoy.***

**- x - x - x -**

*generally, in order to block ads on android, your device either needs to be rooted or use a vpn like blockada etc. these apps can become an unnecessary addition and memory hoggers as well.*

2507, amazon refunded me without sending product back," 

ust stumbled upon this by accident i think. my headset i ordered had a defect where the lights on the side wouldn't show up and i complained to amazon and told them that it is very inconvenient if i had to send them back as it was my only headset i had left int he house. they offered me to give me a refund straight away to repurchase the product. now i'm wondering, is it possible for me to just return the defective one to offset the cost in general and to get everything for free since i checked the orders and there were no changes made to the actual item itself meaning they did not start a refund on the item itself but reinstated.

2528, request: how do i bust a neighbour for illegally renting out apartmen,"i will be writing a bluf below as the post is somewhat long, but please take the time to read the whole thing as it is a bit complex.

**bottom line up front:** a resident has been exploiting this to sublease the additional living space and renting out their own half to people who obviously are only here for vacation (like one week at a time).

how do i bust this person so we can get them thrown out.

**the long story:** we live in a very social housing cooperative that consist of several major families across generations (e.g. i’m a 3rd generation resident) which makes for a truly unique and friendly environment.

due to the extremely cheap prices on apartment shares and ditto monthly rent we have a lot of rules in place to ensure somebody doesn’t try to exploit it.

one of the rules we have in place is that you can only sublease your living space for up to 2 years if you’re only temporarily absent due to disease, studies abroad etc. and only if you get a pre-approval from the board of administration.

the resident living on the top floor in my staircase was lucky to be able to buy the living space next to her as well and unite it into a big apartment, but straight from the get go there was a problem as you have to break down the wall to make it 1 apartment within a short span of time (more than enough) and this person went more than a week over that limit and had to be straight up told to break down the wall within a week of she would forfeit her rights to a share (forced to sell).

well she did, and a few days after a new family moves in to the other half of the living space which is a grey zone but they have lived there “permanently” ever since and it’s not straight up prohibited by our rules - i had a roommate myself when i was in university.

well the shareholder takes a lot of long trips abroad and does seek approval for subleasing the place. it should be noted that you are required *by law* to retain a permanent residence in a housing cooperative, so her frequent trips are bordering expulsion, but the board has so far been lenient.

all this would be fine but she always have people living at the place for a couple of days or weeks while she is out of the country (or possibly just living somewhere else). they don’t speak the language and always come and leave with rollerbags i.e. obviously tourists renting the place.

nobody likes this as there has recently been a surge in break ins and vandalism (though likely not connected) and we have many elderly living here including family.

so not only is she make permanent residents feel unsafe (my neighbours have live in their living space for over 50s and before that lived in another living space in the same cooperative), but she is also in breach of contract and likely overcharging these people as this is also regulated by law.

we can’t do much as we have no rights to check her bank statements or anything in an official capacity and we don’t want to give away that it has been noticed.

what i need is some way to work from the shadows to gather enough evidence to yeet that leech tf out of here. she’s actually quite a friendly person, but of course she is as the rest of us are basically paying the expenses for her “hotel business”.

i’d prefer working on the legal side of things but i don’t mind doing shady shit.

any tips and ideas are welcome!

i live in an apartment building, and we have undeground parking with assigned stalls. i don't know the name or the apartment number of the person who parks beside me. 

i recently noticed that they have a bright yellow swastika painted on their dashboard. it's very noticable. this, understadably, pisses me off. 

for now, i'm giving them the benefit of the doubt before i do anything too drastic. i'm seriously hoping that someone played a cruel prank on the owner of this car, and that the paint will be removed tomorrow. if it's not, i need advice. 

how can i make this person feel as shitty as possible? how can i inconvenience them? 

i don't want to damage their car, as i am the only car who is parked next to them. if i keyed their car or slashed their tires, chances are that it would be traced back to me.

i thought about popping one of their tires so that it would deflate as they drive, meaning that it wouldn't be traced back to me. however, that poses a danger to everyone else on the road around them. 

basically, i need a way to deliver some karma without it being traced back to me.

2545," request. how do i get enough money to leave the country, without scaring people into sending me to prison or something","here is this myth, that accuses everyone of being a liar. though in some situations, such as politics, this is true, i need to make clear first, it's a myth. it is not true. there are many warnings of danger, and far from an exaggeration of the danger, they actually underplay the corrupt and dangerous nature of my society. i know i need to leave, i have no intention of looking for a fight by staying here. my intention is to leave the country, as soon as possible and forever. this is because my ultimate goals are to avoid punishment, and to get the people around me to feel the same way about my conduct as i do. this is to make clear, i don't mean to be a sociopath, i don't mean to be cluster b personality disorder case. i don't enjoy ethics breaches, and i'm absolutely terrible at lying. i think it has something to do with the asperger's, i think that's part of why people treat me so harshly.

if i have a job, my workmates will be inherently mistrustful and perpetually unwary, and are suspicious. they are trying to build a case as to which workmate is antisocial, vindictive, has a victim mentality, is paranoid, is persistently angry, has violent thoughts, and is controlling. i have asperger's, so they might be baffled at that if i speak. another reason why i may not speak is i have sporadic hemiplegic migraines from being involuntarily committed and from outpatient commitment abroad. my mother had that done. my mother accused me of being on drugs, and i think that what she says is the drugs is in reality my migraine meds, acetylcysteine and so forth. in my country, there are an abnormally high rate of active shooting incidents. for example, my country has just been through a war against its own former ally. policy experts all over the world have professed bafflement at this. also, on halloween in community college, a student surrounded by a group of other students shot at me with a fake assault rifle. she and her friends publicly reprimanded me for taking away the fake assault rifle, and demanded it back. i eventually returned it. to this day, i do not know why they did so. she and her friends have proven utterly remorseless for the incident, and my country has a history of unusually many and severe ill-advised policies and doubling down ""heroically,"" actually remorselessly, when warnings from critics that is about to create a journey from bad to worse slowly turn out to be 100% true, which is yet another thing they don't take well to hearing. at the end of an incident that happened when i was punch drunk from an accident, the police kicked me in the back of the right calf. on another day, i witnessed a police officer bending a suspect's handcuffed hands up into a stress position, again and again. countless other police officers were also there, witnessing it. there are countless complaints that in an endless series of cases where someone was wrongfully convicted, the perpetrator was already in prison, or they got away with it because the system wrongfully convicted someone for the simple fact that they had priors, often merely misdemeanors or infractions. in summary, the system is corrupt and incompetent by every means possible, and usually doesn't take well to hearing it. the problem is so severe, that everyday life itself is harder, more unfair, shorter, and less productive, less responsible, less attractive, and less interesting because of it. the simple fact that someone is in this country is an unhealthy habit.

my experience with my countrymen matches this. i don't know if this is just my asperger's, but from what little i can understand, the system is completely corrupt, and neurotypicals confabulate whatever sort of illogic is necessary to infer that the system is right. the system views psychiatry and punishment as some sort of cure-all. through this and other experiences, i have learned the hard way that i cannot change the system, and i need to change to become more like the system. i despise and fear them. r/work once advised me, don't say anything personal, subject to this, speak your mind, subject to this, be yourself. however, i really don't think that's a good idea. there might be a good idea in there somewhere, but overall i think that's a bad idea on the basis has gotten me terrible results in real life and on reddit alike.

once again, i am not sure why this happens, but it may have something to do with people being embarrassed about making concessions. making concessions is taboo, it's considered cowardly, embarrassing, and unfair. this comes out and things like its welfare policy, for example, i am a cash-strapped millennial and i lack the money to leave. people use arguments like the nothing to hide argument and [ergo decedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ergo_decedo) whenever they hear something they don't agree with. even when they agree with something that i said, they find a way to disagree with me somehow. in my experience, people are angry, and anger is just a particularly authoritarian, ambitious, hypocritical, self-righteous and unkind type of fear of being alone or ignored, and whenever they get attention, they use it as an excuse to get more angry and promote others' anger. fear doesn't take well to talking about fear. anger is inimical to things like freedom of speech and communication, and things like when you push on a candidate's name in the ballot box, the candidate's name doesn't suddenly change place with another candidate's name. it goes far beyond winning a single election, a lot of people here, especially way too many of the ambitious and successful ones, don't just have an active shooter mindset. they have a military science fantasy television season length main villain mindset, except they don't just write military science fantasy, they act on it in real life. overall, this country is not just any climate of fear, and it's not even just any climate of anger, it's a climate of [aggressive anger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anger).

i'm concerned, if i say or do anything, they will mistake me for an active shooter waiting to happen. if i complain, they will say i have a victim mentality. if i tell them about my past, they will say i have a victim mentality. if i try to do anything about it, they will attribute it to active shooter red flags. if i do anything about it and succeed, i could reduce people's readiness to the point where an active shooter incident does happen, and though it's not me that did it, everyone will hold me responsible for their reduced readiness. if i show any sort of fear whatsoever, or bring the issue up with them in any way, shape or form, they will use the nothing to hide argument: ""if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear."" then, they will attack on the probably false basis that i have something to hide. in my experience, i have plenty to fear, and to this day, i am not sure exactly what, if anything, i had to hide. for example, i kept a simple sentiment analysis in high school, and when the bullies caught me with it, they reported me and the principal reprimanded me. the reprimand said or implied that the sentiment analysis was some sort of kill list.

i'm not an active shooter, neither former, current, nor future. such people are motivated by power and attention. in contrast, my motivation, in career and in life, is only not being punished. for this, i'll need enough money to leave country, as soon as possible without return. my suggestion is to ingratiate myself to the country and the company, claiming that both have ""that right,"" which is above my paygrade.",UnethicalLifeProTips

ill give a short timeline since i know this is a touchy subject and provide as many details as possible because the last thing i want to do is harass a rape victim and i don't want yall to think that.

1 we enter a public pizzeria, me, friend, 3 other girls 2 other dudes and the girl in question.

2 things are going fine and eventually the girl in question sits on my friends lap and they talk for a bit

 3 a few minutes pass and she starts twerking on him, this was weird but we just kind of laughed it off.

4 we leave the pizzeria and walk around the mall and then we end up leaving later on, a totally normal night.

5 fast forward to today and my friend receives a call from one of the other girls  that were there with us and they ask him if he did anything to the girl in question and if he raped or sexually assaulted her at the pizzeria, he was shocked and said of course not.

6 he tells me about this and i tell him to go to the police and try to get video tapes from the pizzeria or mall but he says he doesn't want to do all that. he has our female friends support so they believe and trust him and so do i but, idk, he called me in tears and i tried to calm him down as he explained this to me, and i feel super bad for him and super pissed off at her and i know that even if he did go to the police i doubt anything that bad or anything at all would happen to her.

2622, request: how to get away with smoking in a non-smoking community,"(resubmitting, fixed title, oops)

i just moved into a new apartment and it's advertised as a completely smoke-free community. no cigarettes, no weed, not even vaping is allowed. the way it was worded in the lease and on every outside notice was with ""smoke free"" in quotations like that, and that they cannot guarantee it will be smoke-free because not everyone will follow the rules, and that they have ""the right but not the obligation"" to fine people $250 per offense, or terminate the lease. i figured this was just a selling point so they could charge more for rent but that they may or may not actually enforce it strictly. we were having a hard time finding anything with availability and not massively overpriced because of covid, so even though we disagreed with that policy, everything else was perfect so we went for it.

so, because from the way it was all worded, i thought as long as we were discreet it shouldn't be an issue. but within our first week our entire building got a notice on our doors that smoking has reportedly been a problem in our building, and reminding everyone with an excerpt from the lease that illegal substances are not allowed etc. i have no idea if this was due to us or other people since we barely smoked anything and we were really careful with it. tons of reviews online, and even one of our new neighbors said they drive around and take pictures of people smoking on their balcony and put it in their mailbox with the fine (he said they did that to him, and imo creeping on people and taking pictures of them is a little too far). like i said, i have no idea that this notice we all got was actually due to us, since we've been super careful with it (even bought an air purifier to blow any weed vapor directly into, we keep our blinds/curtains closed, and we don't even smell anything anywhere inside or out, but it still worries me that they might be being kind of unethical themselves about how they enforce this, so i don't really have any qualms about doing it anyway and hiding it so it's not bothering anyone. it's supposed to be smoke free for the health benefits or whatever, but most of the reviews online are also complaining about this saying how stupid this policy is (it seems to be rather new), and there's an unofficial smoke spot set up with one of those galvanized canisters just outside of the property line that people frequent. based on that, the fact that the reviews are saying people smoke everywhere anyway, and people complaining about the policy online, i assume a lot of the people here don't really take it too seriously and aren't bothered by it but i don't know who would or wouldn't be because we just moved in last week and we only met the one neighbor down the hall. what i'm mostly worried about are the karens and people working for the leasing office spying on us or something.

anwyay, we switched from flower to a vape for our weed, but i am also an avid hookah smoker, which comes with big clouds but the smell is usually pleasant (not like cigs at all, just smells fruity mostly), but there are a lot of indians in our building and i feel like some of them might be more likely to recognize the smell as hookah if it makes its way outside. is there any good way to get away with smoking my hookah or vaping in the apartment without anyone noticing? i'm worried about it getting hazy in here or the smell making it out into the hallway. any good tips on keeping it super discree",UnethicalLifeProTips

2643,: juggalo clown makeup painting can help you trick &amp; thereby dodge facial recognition systems,"according to user [@tahkion](https://www.sciencealert.com/how-to-fool-facial-recognition-technology-with-juggalo-makeup/amp), the key to the success of the makeup is where you put the paint. blacking out the area below the mouth but above the chin - as many juggalos do - tricks facial recognition systems into identifying jawline much closer to the mouth than it really is.

this prevents the system from accurately connecting a person in juggalo makeup to an image of that person without the makeup on.

2699, request: fake ids,"
i am planning a roadtrip across the us with a friend for summer next year; we will both be 18 with full drivers’ licenses etc. 

i am aware of the cost of the car rental/purchase and other driving related issues but because i have family in the us i can sort those out. 

what i am here to ask is more - risky? basically, the drinking age in the us is 21 and to get into bars and clubs you need to be 21. me and my friend here in europe could do all that at 18, and know how to drink and party responsibly. we don’t want to travel across the us but miss out on drinking/clubbing/partying and everything that goes with it. so i have a few questions:

firstly, how does the id situation work in the us. if we get fake u.k. ids saying we’re 21, will they be accepted in clubs? i know legally they won’t, but in real life what actually happens? here in the u.k. legally shops can’t let minors buy alcohol, but every 15 year old has been to a corner shop and bought some without id or by obviously lying about their age. so in the real world, do bars and clubs actually care about ids? and if they do, will they allow a (fake) u.k. id? i should add that we look much older than our age so that won’t be a problem 

secondly, if they won’t accept foreign ids, is it useful to get fake us ids? i understand that each state has it’s own id and other states won’t accept it - does this actually occur in practice? if so, which state’s fake id would you recommend getting? which states are the strictest on this sort of thing? if we have to “isolate “ partying/hooking up to a random part of the country, which would be best? 

thirdly, how serious do the us authorities take underage drinking? if you are over 18 are caught drinking (but are not being reckless and are not misbehaving), what will happen? how often do locals partake? (i’m obviously not talking about drink driving, neither of us are stupid enough to drive after a night out or the day after) 

lastly, how common are fake ids? are they a right of passage that every us teenager will at some point get and so aren’t a big deal, or are they rare and the punishments very severe? again, here in the u.k. many teenagers have fake ids and it’s not bizarre to know someone who frequently uses it. 


thanks for the help. i know some people are gonna be pissed off by these questions and say things like we’re trashy or deserve to rot in jail etc etc but please just reply if you’re going to be helpful! and again, i’m really interested to know how things work in actuality - because what’s required by law and what actually happens as we all know isn’t always the same. 

thanks again",UnethicalLifeProTips

2712," request - car hit me while i was riding my bike on the sidewalk. car driver was an asshole, how do i exploit this for further gain","so i was riding my bike to the store, and when i was going past the driveway to a gas station (mind you, i was still on the sidewalk), i was hit by a car. driver had no choice but to stop as i fell in front of him and the driveway was to small for a hit and run. otherwise i’m fairly certain he would’ve tried to run.

dude refused to offer me any compensation from the get go, except a spare tire for my bike. he even called his insurance up right away, to claim that i was fine, and that the bike was fine except for just part of the wheel (neither were true).

my bike was totalled and aside from some scrapes and road burns, my knee and ankle are sprained pretty bad, to the point where it hurts to stand or walk for decent periods of time. granted in the heat of the moment, the adrenaline kicked in, and i just felt a small stinging feeling in both areas, which gradually got worse as time went by.

i claimed that i needed a new bike as a replacement tire wouldn’t be enough, since the while bike is totalled.

after some disagreement, the driver finally says okay and we head into the store there to get a new bike. 

afterwards, he took a picture of me with the bike, i asked him if i could see his id for liability reasons, and in case the pain in my ankles/knee escalates.

he refused, and threatened me saying that if i go to the police, he will claim i hit his car, because there was a scratch on the side of his front bumper, and that since i took the bike it was a bribe.

i offered to return the bike, yet he was being very aggressive and continued threatening to ‘fuck life up for me, because i wanted to fuck with him’. so to just diffuse the situation i just claimed it was fine for now and left with the bike.

i even tried to return the bike back to store after, as i’m scared it looks like a bribe on my end, however the other guy kept the receipt so they refuse to take it back.

pain in my ankle and knees are much worse now and i’m not sure what to do? granted he was an asshole in basically every regard, i’m thankful for the bike, but i have no problem returning it to him (haven’t even taken the tags off yet). but after all the bullshit he pulled, trying to frame it as if i hit his car, when he was clearly at fault, and that i bribed him, i want to exploit this situation and take it further.

every month i buy one of each treat to give to my own pets. i rave about the product and share experiences.

towards the end of the month i tell people the sale is ending soon

basically, my roommate noticed a charge for $70 on a pizza order they never made and since we weren't about to travel hours away to get delivered a pizza in another province *during a quarantine,* it definitely wasn't any of us.

money-wise, we're not overly worried. it sucks cause we're all really poor, but something like this is pretty easy to prove (in another province, *during a quarantine).*

the website saves your profile, and whoever this guy is left his name, the address he got delivered the pizza, and his phone number. nothing comes up on facebook or google with the guys name in the city he ordered from. the address he ordered to comes up as a community centre. we found the community centre on facebook and messaged them to see if this guy was one of their employees. he could very well just have been a visitor or volunteer though. i'll update on that once we get a response. his phone number registers within the city he ordered from also.

 do not forget!!!!!!  create a new account each time you're about to call yourself.  on the desktop version of textnow, it limits how many accounts you can create, but on the ios textnow app, it let's me create as many accounts as i want.

3. they smoke weed every single second they are at home and it reeks. it gets in my room and it's nasty. (weed is legal here)
4. they never clean up. they leave food and other gross stuff in the kitchen and make everything disgusting (as if puking in the sink isn't gross enough). we even have mice because of them.
5.they have no regard for others. they leave stuff in the laundry for days on end therefore no one can use the washing machines.

i don't do any other parties and i keep quiet to myself. but loud neighbors can be so annoying. especially the smoker ones. so whenever they get too loud, get too roudy, or smoke the heaviest marlboro in the early morning, i just whip up my drone, fly around. not too low, at least two school buses up. when they notice it, they don't know what to do.

the good drones are in the 500-600+ dollars range. you can normally fly them pretty high. they can be quite loud, however, it's better if they don't know who it's coming from. i've been wanting to quiet down the neighbors, their kids scream like psychomaniacs and the parents always get into arguments. the other one has the loudest dogs that bark on unforgivable times. the last one smokes every early morning. so whenever these happen, i like to practice a fly around. they usually get the sign and just go indoors.

2975, guide to never paying rent in california (and getting some cash out of the landlord in the process!),"andlords feel like they can do whatever it takes to make more money, whether it means throwing your cancer-struck grandma out onto the street or fining you a hundred dollars for paying rent late. so why do they think you're the asshole when you don't pay rent?
 
they'll tell you to your face: because they're running a business, and they want to make as much money as they can.
 
well, they might be running a business, but we're running our lives. why shouldn't we make as much money as we can? we don't need to be struck by cancer or lose our jobs or anything else. why should we? they never have any 'reason' besides 'i own this property, so i get to make money off of it'. you rent it, so make money off of it. 

**step one**, get a lease one way or another. the ideal way to do this is to step in on the lease of someone who wouldn't mind you doing this, e.g. a foreign student who's leaving soon. of course, these opportunities are far apart and few between. you might have to end up, e.g. overstaying a 30-day airbnb lease. the key is to make sure the landlord has as little an idea of who they are renting to as possible. keep in mind, you need to stay for at least 30 days for this to work.

**step two**, save up for a lawyer. if you have good legal insurance or can get it cheap you'll have to pay nothing, but most people won't. a lawyer, for the whole case, should run you a few thousand dollars, which should still be far cheaper than rent over the period of the lawsuit. make sure your lawyer is halfway competent and agrees with you in terms of general strategy. does he know what a *delta* motion to quash is, and the fact that some courts no longer accept them? does his fee include writs of mandate, and does he know what a writ of mandate is? will he demur to the complaint? how good is he with getting the clerk to calendar cases? what is his track record and experience? is he afflicted with bourgeois sentiment, or will he fight tooth and nail for tenants, right or wrong? will he file an affirmative lawsuit for you on contingency, or will you have to pay him hourly?
 
**step three**, go around your house. start taking note of everything wrong with it. doesn't matter how minor it seems - you'll find that it often adds up. electrical problems? bathtub clogged? garbage disposal rattling? heater malfunctioning? cabinets not closing? windows letting in a draft? write it all down and take pictures if you can.

**step four**, in coordination with your lawyer, start complaining, then withhold rent. if it is a less professional company, the landlord may bluster, threaten, etc. keep logs of everything, and record everything after the first episode (this is an exception to the two-party consent law), then forward everything to your lawyer. 

**step five**, do not answer the door for people you don't know. if they can't serve you, they'll have to seek an order to post and mail. this will add weeks or even a month or more to the process. your lawyer should take care of everything else after that - make sure you've discussed strategy beforehand with them. at some point, your attorney will file a lawsuit against them demanding restitution for the habitability issues as well as any harassment you may have faced.

**step six**, when the trial date has been set, it's time to leave. as long as you deliver possession before the trial date, they cannot proceed and must dismiss or convert the case to a limited civil action. go get an airbnb or a group living situation and either reapply for a new place or take advantage of the situation you find yourself in next. 

**q: what about my credit score or my public record?**

there is no public record of an eviction in california unless the landlord actually wins. landlords will rarely report to credit bureaus in general. however, you don't know this; as such, try to avoid giving them your ssn in the first place. your lawyer should be able to get you a full release as part of the settlement for the affirmative lawsuit, so this should not be a problem. it's part of the risk you take.

**q: what if my landlord tries to harass or threaten me?**

there is a risk your landlord might try to do something stupid. you look a lot more sympathetic as a *victim* of harassment, and this can substantially increase your payout. all this said, don't be dumb - be armed in case they try anything and by california law, if they attempt to break in, you may use lethal force against them if you feel your life is in danger. however, do *not* reveal that you're armed or anything of the sort unless you truly need to in order to defend your life. brandishing, etc. when you are not in actual danger is a good way to get the police interested, which you do not want. in any case, if you have a corporate landlord, it is unlikely they will do all that much but put a notice up on your door.

**q: isn't this his property? what stops him from just coming in?**

real property is a bundle of sticks. when a landlord leases to you, or to someone who then assigns the lease to you, he hands you the stick of possession. you effectively own the property as against the whole world, including the person holding legal title. he is nothing but a trespasser on your property, and you can deal with him as if he is nothing but a trespasser if he attempts to come in and fuck with you. while he can, by statute, enter upon giving 24 hours notice, he can only do so if he has a good reason, and he cannot do so if doing so would lead to a breach of the peace even if he does have a good reason.

**q: how am i going to get a good reference?**

usually, the landlord will agree to a positive or neutral reference as part of any settlement. if all else fails, you can simply hop on to a roommate situation and get friends to vouch for you/get an airbnb, if you can't get good formal references or fake them. then, use those references to push yourself into your next situation.

**q: what about my record? even if the eviction is confidential, won't future landlords see my lawsuits against the landlords?**

make sure you sue as a john doe, alleging fear of retaliation, physical harm, etc. this works better if you are a former victim of domestic violence or something similar.

**q: lawyers are evil; imprison us, lawyers make our lives hell. why should i trust a lawyer?**

call some. talk to them over the phone. hire the one that sounds both friendly and sociopathic. they're evil, but if you get one they'll be evil for you. or do it yourself, if you've got the time and resolve.

**q: i don't trust the law, and i'll never believe it's on my side.**

you won't know unless you try. if you're in california, try to find a way to sue your landlord in san francisco or some other liberal jurisdiction (for example, look up property records to see if the person that owns your property also has properties there). your lawyer will help you with this.

**q: my landlord has more money than me - won't he win?**

most non-debt-collection or eviction lawsuits are by poor people against rich people, because it's usually rich people who rip poor people off without ending up in prison, and almost all lawsuits settle. it's not poor people paying the money in those settlements.

**q: how does this interact with covid?**

in the bay area, before covid, it could take more than 12 months to evict a tenant. now? hope you enjoy having a stable, long-term place to live rent-free.

**q: isn't this fraud?**

i'd like to build a 250m² penthouse on the integrity of our roof, in other words an additional floor.
based on ly calculations if i manage to do that i could make +/- 200.000€ of profit by selling the penthouse afterwards and live very confortably (fire?).

legally speaking in order to build the penthouse i need all other owner's permission before being allowed to start everything. i need to make them all sign a document in which is clearly written ""we allow /u/spreadlegshat to build a penthouse on the roof of our building"".

thing is i have to be able to convince them to sign the document... they might say ""wow that's a great idea you have there, i want to do that too!"" but the issue then is that legally speaking (not going to go into details of belgian law and all our peculiarities) in our case only one apartment/penthouse can be built....

2985,: actual tip for easy money.,";dr: get a ""job""

call centers hire literally anyone. at my first job one of the supervisors was a convicted pedo on the registry. i've since been hired for two others, and for all three i was hired directly after interview. one of them was just a phone interview. i have a real job now btw, i'll hopefully never have to work in a call center again.

call centers also usually have a training period ranging from a week to two months.

so, assuming your schedule allows you to take on a full time ""job"", even for just a little while, you can easily apply for a call center - where you're guaranteed to be hired as long as you aren't actively doing heroin in the interview room - and get paid to sit in a room and listen to a trainer talk/do dumb quizzes about the job. then you can quit before you ever have to take a call. repeat for any other call centers in town. hell, repeat at the same call center in a month or two. they'll probably rehire you anyway. bonus: right now most call centers are work-from-home, so you'll probably be using zoom/skype for the training. you can turn off your video and do whatever tf you want while the trainer talks.

assuming minimum wage is $8, that's anywhere from $320 to $2560 depending how long training is. some call centers pay more than minimum wage too, since no one wants to work there, and still have about the same hiring standards because again nobody wants to fucking work there.",UnethicalLifeProTips

2989, 90% off designer goods,"first step is to find a refunding service, without sacrificing too much nuance it’s a person who social engineers an order to get you a refund no matter what.

contact the person who’s doing the refunding and read all of their requirements to actually be eligible for said service. then, place your order.

let’s say you want 5000$ worth of stuff because your greedy, well you’d need that 5000$ to actually place the order, but you would get refunded the 5000$ and pay the refunder a 10% fee, all whilst still getting the things delivered.

tldr: find refund service, make sure your eligible, place order, get a refund + items delivered

3075, request: manipulative ex-friend,"he sits at the center of two of my friend groups due to his location and proximity to places we go.

he asserts things about past events and sprinkles in lies to make me in particular seem weird, like the asshole, or wrong or other traits.

he has been successful with this. if i let some assertion stand, and he twists it later, i’m the asshole for quibbling or for denying the past.

example: (skippable)

one time someone stopped me at a lgs we play at because i took the women’s restroom key (i’m trans and i was trying to assert it more subtly than telling eferyone).

i get accosted by the store owner. i explain the situation but i’m in tears. i get back to the table and he starts digging into me and calling me a weirdo or a pervert. i just say that i’m trans. and he keeps doing it. makes fun of me for it. im already emotional, then i get pissed off and tell him to shut the fuck up and to stop talking to me.

and then later it gets brought up. and i was the weirdo and totally wasn’t clear and he wasn’t even mocking me or being insensitive. or so everyone believes now.

this happens a lot. assertions of lies or manipulations. my friend group usually just gets banter, but he for some reason is extremely malevolent and vicious towards me. he blew up last night after i laid this out in more diplomatic terms. he was shouting and swearing at me in a voice call, then i left and he said he was being “patient and listening” and that i was being aggressive after i said i was busy with work. and if i press him on it, i’m just “taking banter seriously” and i have “no ability to take a joke.” and if most people present think he’s in the wrong, then he plays the fool and says it was all ironic.

i have evidence he was smoking pot, which is grounds for a heavy punishment from his school. i also know he has details on me that would get me in trouble with my family (trans vs traditional catholics), so i want this to be something that isn’t explicitly linked back to me.

i know his address, his parents, and i have his social media.

&amp;#x200b;

i'm a 16yo guy who's academic career has basically been ruined by a certain person. i'd rather kill myself than see this guy with a smile on his face. 

&amp;#x200b;

some backstory on what happened :

&amp;#x200b;

i am an arab but i live in belgium,  and there are a lot of racist people here. 4 years ago i entered the school that i am currently still in. it was clear from the beginning that 80% of the staff  were massive racist assholes. but, whatever, i've dealt with people like this all my life so i can handle it. 

after a month or two it became clear to me that this particular principal (and his right hand) really had something against me. he started making up stories about me and spreading them across the teachers. this continued for 4 years, every day i would be sent to his office for some stupid shit and receive suspensions or other punishments.

one day, the school came to me and said i would need to sign a contract saying i could not violate the rules or i would immediately be expelled immediately. if i didn't  sign they would kick me out. i signed. 

i have no fucking clue how i survived that year but the contract was supposed to expire after a year. now, after they pulled that, they send us a message saying that they want to extend the contract.  i'm not fucking okay with this, i did exactly as they told me to, sat still all day like a mindless robot and they want to do this? 

now there are many more things this guy has done. i know he's a racist because every minority student at school has to deal with the same shit. i know he's a pedophile because we caught him blatently staring at girls' asses. i know he has a car, he's unmarried and i have his e-mail adress. i can get his phone number and adress but that'll take a bit longer. he's single handedly responsible for ruining my academic career, it's too late to transfer schools, and even if i could, they're all full anyways.

how can i ruin this guys life anonymously?

3102,: you don't actually have to pay rent in california.,"**step one**, get a lease one way or another. the ideal way to do this is to step in on the lease of someone who wouldn't mind you doing this, e.g. a foreign student who's leaving soon. of course, these opportunities are far apart and few between. most likely, you'll just apply and be accepted like a normal person.

**step two**, save up for a lawyer. i used legal insurance for this and had to pay nothing, but most people won't have an affordable group legal insurance plan like myself. a lawyer, for the whole case, should run you a few thousand dollars, which should still be far cheaper than rent over the period of the lawsuit. make sure your lawyer is halfway competent and agrees with you in terms of general strategy. does he know what a *delta* motion to quash is, and the fact that some courts no longer accept them? does his fee include writs of mandate, and does he know what a writ of mandate is? will he demur to the complaint? how good is he with getting the clerk to calendar cases? what is his track record and experience? is he afflicted with bourgeois sentiment, or will he fight tooth and nail for tenants, right or wrong? will he file an affirmative lawsuit for you on contingency, or will you have to pay him hourly?
 
**step three**, go around your house. start taking note of everything wrong with it. doesn't matter how minor it seems - you'll find that it often adds up. electrical problems? bathtub clogged? garbage disposal rattling? heater malfunctioning? cabinets not closing? windows letting in a draft? write it all down and take pictures if you can.

**step four**, in coordination with your lawyer, start complaining, then withhold rent. if it is a less professional company, the landlord may bluster, threaten, etc. keep logs of everything, and record everything after the first episode (this is an exception to the two-party consent law), then forward everything to your lawyer. 

**step five**, do not answer the door for people you don't know. if they can't serve you, they'll have to seek an order to post and mail. this will add weeks or even a month or more to the process. your lawyer should take care of everything else after that - make sure you've discussed strategy beforehand with them. at some point, your attorney will file a lawsuit against them demanding restitution for the habitability issues as well as any harassment you may have faced.

**step six**, when the trial date has been set, it's time to leave. as long as you deliver possession before the trial date, they cannot proceed and must dismiss or convert the case to a limited civil action. go get an airbnb or a group living situation and either reapply for a new place or take advantage of the situation you find yourself in next. 

**q: what about my credit score?**

there is no public record of an eviction in california unless the landlord actually wins. landlords will rarely report to credit bureaus in general. however, you don't know this; as such, try to avoid giving them your ssn in the first place. your lawyer should be able to get you a full release as part of the settlement for the affirmative lawsuit, so this should not be a problem. however, it's part of the risk you take.

**q: what if my landlord tries to harass or threaten me?**

there is a risk your landlord might try to do something stupid. you look a lot more sympathetic as a *victim* of harassment, and this can substantially increase your payout. all this said, don't be dumb - be armed in case they try anything and by california law, if they attempt to break in, you may use lethal force against them if you feel your life is in danger. however, do *not* reveal that you're armed or anything of the sort unless you truly need to in order to defend your life. brandishing, etc. when you are not in actual danger is a good way to get the police interested, which you do not want. however, if you have a corporate landlord, it is unlikely they will do all that much but put a notice up on your door.

**q: isn't this his property? what stops him from just coming in?**

real property is a bundle of sticks. when a landlord leases to you, or to someone who then assigns the lease to you, he hands you the stick of possession. you effectively own the property as against the whole world, including the titled owner. he is nothing but a trespasser on your property, and you can deal with him as if he is nothing but a trespasser if he attempts to come in and fuck with you. while he can, by statute, enter upon giving 24 hours notice, he can only do so if he has a good reason, and he cannot do so if doing so would lead to a breach of the peace even if he does have a good reason.

**q: how am i going to get a good reference?**

usually, the landlord will agree to a positive or neutral reference as part of any settlement. if all else fails, you can simply hop on to a roommate situation and get friends to vouch for you, if you can't get good formal references or fake them.

**q: isn't this fraud?**

i'll tell you why.

(let's suppose you sell stuff that's used to do some labor, like stuff for construction workers, plumbers, and so on)

first off. boomers. they're still the bosses. they worked for decades and now they have a higher position. that inflated their ego and make them stop learning new things after 1978. that means they will decide. nobody will be able to stop them. 

 if you're a vendor, you'll be selling stuff to mostly boomers and probably their younger employees. but of course the boss will never ask for the younger guys'opinons. we can rule that out.

just speak slowly. make up terms if you need to. repeat concepts they liked. boomers don't fact check. 

second, make them laugh. say stupid shit. it really works. mostly joke about women (sex and marriage)

after a couple months they put me through to a debt collector, who then offered $10 a week and they squash the interest rate.  


you can also low-ball them on payment arrangements and most of the time they'll be happy to accept, this i've also done multiple times, lowering demanded payments by up to 75%.  


it'll always be a good idea to pay them back faster obviously, but if you're in a situation like i was in, where that extra few dollars saved doing this equals a few nights dinners, it's better.",UnethicalLifeProTips

3116,: getting rejected before you even get invited for an interview? lie on your job application as long as you can back it up.,"when you apply for a job you are trying to sell the product that is your labor. nobody will hire you out of the kindness of their heart but because they think you fill that role best out of all the applicants. and let's be straight here. your employer will bullshit you from the moment they write the job ad. their human resources department will talk about ""great teamwork"" and ""professionalism"" without even knowing the names of your future colleagues or they will try to sell you minimum wage as ""fair payment"". 

&amp;#x200b;

of course, there are things you can't or shouldn't lie about. it would be straight-up illegal to fake your grades and it is rather easy to check on some of the information in your resume. so no, you aren't suddenly a harvard graduate.   
what you can do however is photoshop your picture. it's the first thing the recruiter will see and first impressions do matter. got some pimples, unclean skin? you can either ask a photographer to correct that for you or if you got the skills do it yourself for free.  but don't be stupid and overdo it. no recruiter will actively look for traces of photoshop but it can be obvious if you overdo it. also, put on a suit and tie. even if you have to borrow them from your dad or someone else.   


now for the application itself. you need to make it clear that you have a passion for whatever bullshit job it is you are applying for. gonna assemble burgers at mcdonald's? guess what cooking is your greatest hobby even if you only ever eat mcdonald's yourself. they will not ask you to recite some recipe in the interview, don't worry. 

&amp;#x200b;

and yes this sounds silly but mentioning that you love to eat at that places let's them know that you are already familiar with the menu and everything. take a look at their website. mention some information that makes it clear you informed yourself beyond the job ad even though you only copy-paste some shit. 

&amp;#x200b;

make up internships to fake job-experience. if it's only a 2-4 week internship most recruiters won't bother checking every little detail of your resume. they will still notice them tho. and the maximum of research they will do is a quick google search. if they can't find anything they will most likely give you the benefit of the doubt. not every business in the world has an internet presence. and if they ask you just pretend that it's possible you mistyped the information. depending on where you live your data is protected and they can't just make calls asking other recruiters about you. 

&amp;#x200b;

got some big holes in your career where you just didn't work for whatever reason? write something about caring fulltime for a sick family member. this is a highly sensitive topic. so most recruiters will just brush over it if not mention it at all. and if they ask you about it you can just tell them that it's personal and you don't wanna talk about it. if you made that family member up there is no chance they will ever meet them and be able to follow up on this.

&amp;#x200b;

last but not least delete your social media or set them to private. if you are on facebook just googling your name and city will lead to your profile. so all your employer should be able to see is your name and your profile picture and that's it. your resume has to be the only source of information available to them to be entirely certain your lies won't be discovered.   


and even if you get rejected do not give up. because the worst thing that could happen already happend. write a follow up e-mail asking why you got rejected. this will give you feedback for your next application. send your resume again, this time improved with the information they gave you. go a little out of your way to show that you really want a chance at this. you can even offer to take a short internship so your employer can get to know you.",UnethicalLifeProTips
3117,: take advantage of the pandemic and apply for jobs that you wouldn't otherwise be qualified for right now,"i can't speak for the entire country but i can speak for about 45 markets nationwide where i am currently a recruiter: there is still a shortage of candidates on the market right now due to people not wanting to come back to work during covid. i think that is only going to last a few more weeks.

as a recruiter (yes i stayed in human resources after the trainer position i left at the collections call center, but definitely now at a way better company; i had to get out of that entire shit hole industry), i am currently getting slammed with a ton of underqualified candidates... and they are getting the jobs because there aren't a lot of candidates in the market right now.

summer is typically extremely slow for candidates; in talent acquisition we typically save learning and development projects for july and august because the candidate pool slows down significantly. add the summer slowdown to a pandemic and you have a hiring crisis for most employers.

 even if the job post claims it requires a degree you don't have, or a certain number of years of experience, screw it. throw your hat in the ring. companies need people and they need them right the fuck now and a lot of them are still working at home and training remotely. (obvi watch out for scams though. no employer should ask you to pay to join, or pay to be trained, and any time your social security number is collected it should be through a secure background check company onlyor as part of a secure payroll company when you're onboarding and officially hired).

 if you need a job, and it's in an industry where you can work from home, or if you are comfortable with the social distancing measures, aim for the moon right now. you really might get your dream job or a job few steps up from what you might have been able to get 8 months ago.",UnethicalLifeProTips

here’s the problem. this old grouchy hag who overlooks the pool and has loved here for 35 years. she has keys to the pool house and the new management doesn’t have to balls to change the locks so just deal with her. she really has it out for me because one day a group of kids broke the rules, but they leaved when i asked and i let the manager know. this wasn’t good enough for her and she cussed me out for letting it happen. whatever. i’m not the fucking police. 
she comes in when i’m not here and rearranges all the chairs and puts these fucking lawn chairs everywhere that make my job harder. it’s the midwest, so the wind just blows them all over the bushes and into the pool. and there’s already 20 chairs out so pretty unnecessary. i just put them away when i come in if she has them out.

i didn't want to post this, but after a ton of back and forth with spotify support i realize they don't care about this issue at all. long story short, someone used their personal email to sign up, then used my university email to verify their spotify student status (sheer id verification) and spotify wouldn't do anything about it unless i contacted them from that person's email. i tried to get them to do something, but they kept on saying there was nothing they could do unless i contacted them from that person's personal email.

so here's how you do it. you can sign up with any email for the free version, or use your existing account. then, select the student premium option and they'll ask you to input some information. it's best if you already know of someone's email address, but you can also make one up. ex. johnsmith@purdue.edu . then, enter the name and age of ""a university student"" and voila, your account is verified. 

also, once sheer id verifies you, spotify has no way of tracking which email you used to verify the student status with. when i tried to get them to do something about a certain person using my university email, they said that they could not locate it. i tried this just now, and it worked. not sure if they'll patch up the issues soon though.",UnethicalLifeProTips

now i have an account at a different bank they have absolutely no access to. the only problem is, i can't obtain the account and routing number for this account (the one i want to transfer funds to). this bank's website doesn't allow me to view my routing number and account number on their online banking. also, because of the nature of my current situation, i can't just call and be like ""hey i need my account number and routing number so i can transfer money"" without prematurely raising alarm - i have little privacy at the moment and will continue to not until i've done what i need to do.

3211,: why you should speak your mind sometimes instead of telling people what they want to hear all the time.,"because your mind is better than their mind, and it's better than what they want to hear.

because if you disagree with them, you can get more attention from them.

because if you agree with them, you can make sure you're on the same page and you can take credit for it and form a clique.

because if you know it's a lie, then other people will know that just hearing it, because if it fails to convince you, it's probably because it's not psychologically manipulative enough.

because if you know it's a lie, when it gets called a lie, you'll get blamed for it. if you don't know it's a lie, then when it gets called a lie, anyone that is not you will get blamed for it.

because if when you speak your mind, people know you're wrong, it's probably because someone told you lies. when you speak your mind in this case, you can figure out what their lies are, and who to retaliate against.

because if when you speak your mind, you're wrong, but no one knows that, you can cause more chaos that benefits you, or you can find out that you're in a den of losers, and you need to leave.

because if someone there believes that everyone is a liar, then when you speak your mind, it creates ambiguity by confusing them.

because your job is to be the smart guy, and it's your job to enlighten the group so that the situation may survive and function. for example, let's say the boss wants to hear that potassium is stronger and less flammable than lithium. it's your job to do tensile testing, and if you allow the boss to make the aircraft out of potassium, the company will go under and you will no longer have a job there. if you demonstrate to the team that lithium is better to use in aircraft, he will fire you, and payroll department will go around his back and pay you severance because they know you're right.

because the company hired you because they knew you were lying about your skills in the job interview, and they don't want anyone smart enough to replace the boss. your job is to be the dumb guy, and if you lie, you could make yourself seem mentally overqualified. you could get jealous flak from a lot of people, or maybe they're on the wrong track, and they don't want thinking people.

because police and courts have preconceptions about how intelligent offenders are.",UnethicalLifeProTips

hey guys so pretty much i’ve had a debt of around $2,500 on a credit card from boa that they sold to a collection agency. i talked to the agency about it and said that i will pay. i gave them their bank details and told them to email me a letter that states that i paid the balance. 

they sent the letter instantly, which is great, but the money still hasn’t come out of my account yet, which is even greater! now my question is, can i move the money from the account or something to avoid paying it? if they say hey the payment didn’t go thru, can i just say idk about that since i have a letter from you guys saying that i paid it already?

i paid the whole thing off no problem cause i’m trying to improve my credit and all but boa told me that they won’t even take it off my credit report. the item will state “paid in full” from the people they sold the debt to, which is great, but what i really wanted was for them to take it off my report completely, which they won’t do anyways so i don’t really feel bad. 

could this come to bite me back later since i’m trying to fix my credit? the way the process works is that the collections agency will tell boa that i paid my debt and then boa will report to the credit bureaus saying i paid in full. when boa doesn’t correctly state paid in full on the credit report in like a month, i can call them and send them the letter saying it states that i paid, even tho the collections will probs say that i never did?

3274,: i feel bad even sharing this," 

before i begin, i did not use this in an unethical way, but it did open my eyes to the massive possibility of abuse.

i moved a month ago and in the move my flatscreen television was broken. i love television as much as anyone and ordered a replacement off amazon. for the sake of accuracy and the potential for replication of this unethical tip, the tv was on the higher price side ($2k). after 2 weeks of waiting and meeting a freight delivery guy at my building i was finally back in action.

about 30 days into ownership i noticed the back light of the television was sometimes staying on after power down. i actually noticed in the morning so it was literally staying on all night. i thought it a fluke, but then it continued to happen. the solve was rather simple, just power the tv on and off again. no biggie. i went online to see if others with the television had experienced this issue. low and behold it wasn't super uncommon. there was even a guy who had the tv replaced by the same model which also had the same back light issue. many thought a future firmware update would fix it, but after spending money i figured i should consider replacing it.

i reached out to the amazon seller and they asked for a picture/video of the issue and the serial number off the television. i have no doubt based on their response that this was a known problem and their solution was

1. to offer to arrange for pickup, a return and full refund of the television or
2. take a $400 credit to keep the television.

choice 2 also mentioned that if i ever desired to revert to step 1. that i could do so within the warranty period provided by amazon and would still have access to the extended warranty through the manufacturer. this was a no brainer and in my eyes excellent customer service. now you may be asking? where's the unethical tip? see below:

tl:dr order an expensive television off of amazon (if you need one). look up common defects in that model. find a picture online that shows the issue. get free money in the form of a partial refund to just keep the tv (i got $400). sellers would prefer this vs. taking back a broken television on top of the lost freight cost.",UnethicalLifeProTips

3290,: how to live as an illegal immigrant in england if you have no way of attaining legal citizenshi,"for any fellow working class people like myself with few marketable skills and who are interested in an adventure and willing to work, befriending irish travelers is a great way to stay in england for an extended period of time undocumented.

some background: 

in england there's an ethnic group known as irish travelers, commonly referred to as ""gypsies"" by the english. many travelers really hate being called gypsies and see it as a derogatory term. many travelers live as nomads and will set up caravan camps on unused/undeveloped land, often on the edge of farm fields where they squat for 30 days before they can be lawfully removed and they move on to a new site, some communities of travelers aren't as mindful as others about leaving no trace, and they can tear up the fields and leave trash piles which is one reason why they are despised. not all communities of travelers are nomadic and many have established communities on the outskirts of many english towns. 

you have to realize that the traveler way of life is centuries old and dates back before private property was really a thing, and also is the result of centuries of discrimination which kept these people in poverty and from owning land.

the magna carta (the document that the us constitution was based on, and all modern democracies were influenced by) in particular the charter of the forest, guaranteed and protected the rights of the peasants to have unfettered access to the land so that they could use natural resources to sustain themselves. this is in part the origin of traveler culture in england.

travelers make their living doing various odd jobs, roofing, landscaping, painting, scrapping, construction, demolition, etc, with a smattering of various illegal activities thrown in; cock fighting and unsanctioned boxing matches for example. the irish travelers are a tight knit community and look out for each other and if you prove yourself to them most will extend that generosity to you and help you out with most anything you need.

i spent a good amount of time around irish travelers in england, the majority are good people. unfortunately most english citizens conveniently overlook the daily harassment, systemic, and institutional discrimination and oppression the traveler community faces and how that feeds into their own suspicions and contempt towards outsiders. a good place to look for a traveler community to integrate into would be at a pub frequented by travelers or on the outskirts of a small to mid size town. travelers tend to live on the outside and more isolated parts of towns and cities because it's easier for them to avoid being harassed and to stay out of the eye of the law. 

many travelers unfortunately fall into the vices of poverty and often run afoul of the law which is how they have earned a negative reputation. i think it's bullshit how travelers are treated and i've seen how their treatment by the english marginalizes them and makes ethnic tensions worse. 

many irish travelers are wary of strangers and are rough around the edges, but they're cool with americans and other outsiders. just have a good sense of humor, don't take yourself too seriously, and have a thick skin and you'll fit right in. i worked with some irish travelers for a few days while i was in england for 6 months because i was bored, the work is hard but you won't be working insane hours, generally around 6-10 most days. 

most irish travelers pride themselves on putting in a full day of work, they see the rest of the english as lazy, and after having worked with travelers i will never doubt the traveler work ethic, but as a working class american who has worked 10-12 hour days 6-7 days a week doing manual labor they still don't work as hard as we do, ha. but i much prefer the traveler way of life because they live as they please and don't answer to anyone.",UnethicalLifeProTips

3311, request: what unethical ways can i do to get sole custody of my kid legally,"a lot of people might be triggered from the title so i'm going to write down a little back story. 

i was in the military 2 years ago and found out my wife cheated on me while i was deployed. i got out of the military for my family so we can be all together and live a happy life then i found out she's been cheating on me. we eventually got divorced and she got custody of our kid because of all the lying that she did. she also stole all my life savings away and the way she did it,  according to the judge, its not against the law. family law are biased against dads and just give primary custody to mothers because thats how they make money. anyways, my ex is trying to meet this guy she met online and she is bringing our daughter with her. i really think its dangerous to meet a guy online and taking our daughter with her. she is really young. i cant do anything because she has primary custody. i am a good man. i never hit anyone before. i go to work to pay child support, i didnt do any revenge to her even after stealing all my life savings away. i just want my daughter to be safe but law will not do anything about it until its too late. she lied to the judge that i am abusive and alcoholic but i never hit her not even once. i drink 1 beer probably in like every 3 months. what are unethical ways to legally get my kid from her? as far as i know, she doesn't do drugs, she use guys to buy her stuff and be good in life, and she's not alcoholic. she's a nice person in the outside. i was told that in my situation, unless she gets into an alcohol related incident three times, proof that she's a drug addict, i will not get sole custody of my kid. i am getting hopeless.",UnethicalLifeProTips
3312," request: my abusive alcoholic father may be dying in six months, how can i rekindle a relationship with him and inherit his house","my dad sucks. he beat my mother growing up, left me with a pedophile (it ended the way you’d expect) and constantly villafied my mother growing up. i was raised by my mother and have lived with him a year out of my life. that year was split up between him losing custody because he started drinking again (he is and was a huge alcoholic), then me moving in with him in adulthood only for him to kick me out (in 95 degree weather without any warning whatsoever) in an attempt to manipulate me into letting him sell my parrot. i tried time and time again to have a legitimate relationship with the man but i’ve never been successful. 

now, i don’t hate people because they’re alcoholics. it’s a tough addiction and i applaud anyone who tries to get over it. my father, however, is a mean drunk. very mean. he punches holes in the walls, disowns me and reowns me, tells blatant lies about my past and tries to guilt me into feeling sorry for him. 

after not speaking to him for a year, i’ve just heard that he may be in liver failure. he has two houses, one on mortgage and another he owns outright. i would like to inherit them because owning a house would be a huge step up in my life at my age (22). 

my father supposedly has narcissistic personality disorder, though i’m not sure if that’s diagnosed or not. if it isn’t, he definitely shows symptoms. here’s my request: 

how can i contact him again and rekindle a relationship without him being suspicious? i’m not the manipulative type most of the time and already feel guilty considering doing this. my concern is that i’m sure my dad would put something in a will saying i don’t get anything. i’d like to be on his good side. at this point he’s ruined my life once and tried to twice, and beyond the requisite “he’s my father” i don’t care all that much about him. i don’t want him to die, but if he is going to, i don’t want to miss out on an opportunity to get a house.",UnethicalLifeProTips

3315,": if you really want to avoid having to make a credit card payment, just move your statement issue date.","saw the post about buying something and refunding it to get out of your minimum payment - that won't work because the credit won't be treated as a payment unless it clears the entire card balance. 

however...if your credit card company allows you to move your statement issue date, wait until a week or so before your statement is issued and ask them to move it to a week ago. as they can't retrospectively issue the statement, it'll get pushed off until the following month. your minimum payment can't be due until after the statement is issued and so you get another month. 

you can actually do the same thing next month and keep shifting the date back, theoretically indefinitely. at the company i worked for, it was entirely within the rules - to the extent that when a rep refused to do this for someone that had done this for four months in a row without making a single payment and i refused on the escalated call because of the obvious exploit, i eventually overturned by our complaints team because they couldn't identify anything in the t&amp;cs that prevented it.

few notes of caution - you can't do this after the statement is issued and you'll still incur interest if you have a balance from the previous months statement. but it definitely works.",UnethicalLifeProTips

i like to store my... ""homework"" in c:\\windows, and rename homework.zip to something like win32.dll or something ""normal"" people wouldn't usually pay much mind to. whenever you wanna open it again, you just rename it back to a .zip file, and there you go. if you wanna add more files to your folder, you can just drag and drop them into the winrar window, and it will ask you about ""archive name and parameters"". you can ignore everything and click ok or press enter, but i recommend selecting ""store"" under compression method instead of ""normal"", as it can be a bit faster, since the files won't be compressed. same thing when you're zipping for the first time.

if you try to open a .zip file that was renamed to another file extension, it obviously wont work (unless you're an idiot and renamed your .zip to a .rar or something like that).

note: in order to modify file extensions, you're gonna need to enable viewing file name extensions. to do this, open file explorer, at the top menu click view, and check the box that says file name extensions at the top right.

note 2: when saving more files inside your .zip, if it has multiple folders inside, save to one folder at a time. if you try to save to more than one folder at a time, it won't work since it's ""being used by another program"" (your other process of winrar saving files to the zip).",UnethicalLifeProTips

call centers hire literally anyone. at my first job one of the supervisors was a convicted pedo on the registry. i've since been hired for two others, and for all three i was hired directly after interview. one of them was just a phone interview. i have a real job now btw, i'll hopefully never have to work in a call center again.

call centers also usually have a training period ranging from a week to two months.

so, assuming your schedule allows you to take on a full time ""job"", even for just a little while, you can easily apply for a call center - where you're guaranteed to be hired as long as you aren't actively doing heroin in the interview room - and get paid to sit in a room and listen to a trainer talk/do retarded quizzes. then you can quit before you ever have to take a call. repeat for any other call centers in town. hell, repeat at the same call center in a month or two. they'll probably rehire you anyway. bonus: right now most call centers are work-from-home, so you'll probably be using zoom/skype for the training. you can turn off your video and do whatever tf you want while the trainer talks.",UnethicalLifeProTips

many of those places allow you to use them as mancaves or makeshift workshops to hang out in all day. you just gotta keep the door open while you do it. 

 so you bring in stuff that hides your sleeping area. you can make walls out of shelving units filled with boxes to keep any management/nosey employees from easily finding you. make it a maze/and or block their way with boxes so they cannot easily get to you. buy a motion-detecting driveway alert or doorway alert that has an alert tone that is the sound of  a phone ringing (i own one that does this) to wake you up when someone enters your unit. 

then you can jump up and act like you are reorganizing or any activity that isnt sleeping.  

you could also make a completely hidden sleeping area that no one can find .... like a large box you get inside to sleep. you can lock it from the inside. 

-----------------------

another idea (while i'm at it).... make a deal with another person that roughly looks like you that works days so you can alternate your sleeping in the unit. you go to sleep during the day... your partner leaves and locks you in until he comes back from his job after his shift, and you switch places. you lock him in while you go to work. note: be sure to have a power tool in the unit that can easily cut you out in case of an emergency. both wear the same outfit when coming and going so it appears as if the same person comes in for a 20 minutes or so and then leaves. so any employees seeing you (or watching security camera footage) will think you are the same person.

3521, request: how can i passive aggressively annoy my upstairs neighbors,"first i’ll start by saying that the apartment unit i am in is part of a larger house that contains 3 other units. i am living in a 1 bedroom downstairs and upstairs is a two bedroom that stretches the span of my bedroom and living space. 

my relationship with these neighbors got off on such a bad start and it just kept going down hill. they moved in after a family of 4 were above us for a year. i would never be able to tell there was a family up there, super quiet. of course since it’s an old building you could hear the occasional creak but nothing crazy.

the new neighbors moved in and within one week it was already a disaster. i assume it’s their first apartment together outside of home and as a couple because they’re considerably young. they had so many parties on a weekly basis. always sunday night into monday morning. we asked them to be mindful of us and the other neighbors and they continued as if nothing happened. nothing short of me calling the cops on them at 4am monday morning settled it down. 

i don’t want to be that person. i’ve lived in many tight spaces in large cities all over the world and have never had issues like this on a consistent basis. 

eventually other issues arose from trash being thrown from their windows into our yard, misplacing their trash bins and replacing them by only taking others yet still finding ways to lose those ( i have no idea where all these cans are they took), constant foot traffic at all hours of the night not only from them but their cat.

i’m sort of at my wits end here. i’m for sure moving out of here in the foreseeable future but for now i’m starting to see red and after talking with them about all of the issues that have been affecting myself and our neighbors, they don’t feel obliged to care or change.

i would love some little jabs that i can pull to ‘return the favor’, so to say. i’ve started blasting my television when they have theirs cranked and can’t even make out the sounds of the speakers in my own room. they seem to get it and lower the television. 

when their cat is running at all hours of the night at wakes me up (most nights) i’ll make a bunch of low frequency noise below their bedroom for a bit and i can hear them wake up and grab the cat.

i thought this would be a good place to get some tips on how to deal with this situation and satisfy my revenge tooth. the management company won’t do anything about it because they sold the property to some huge development firm. the neighbors are not even supposed to have an animal but i don’t know if i have leverage here because of the transition in owners.

yesterday we were in our basement and noticed water damage coming down from the top of the wall, above the ground-line outside. it looks like it might be from the ceiling. we've been having issues with our garbage disposal in our kitchen not working and this spot is right below our kitchen sink and dishwasher. based on my googling, this would not be covered by insurance because it doesn't seem to be a sudden broken pipe. you can see the bubbling and it feels slightly cool (barely) but not wet, and it's not like water is spraying everywhere. i think it's been going on for a while (maybe a week? a month?) but we just didn't know because we are never down there. any tips on what we need to do or say to get this covered by insurance? do we need to literally bust a pipe and let it start spraying everywhere? describe it a certain way? avoid saying certain things? dropping thousands upon thousands of dollars outside insurance is basically giving me a heart attack. thanks so much for any advice!!",UnethicalLifeProTips

3539,: how to fool the tsa,"all credit goes to garynuman9

actually want to avoid tsa bullshit and never have your luggage lost ~and~ be able to fly with reasonably well concealed edibles or concentrates?

fly with a gun in your checked bag.

seriously.

it's a simple form you have to fill out, totally legal &amp; normal. just let them know you need the appropriate form to declare a firearm at the check in counter.

you fill it out, go to an area where your bag is searched by hand by tsa in front on you, you lock it, it's never opened again after that point.

pro's of this approach.

you are required by federal law to use a non tsa lock &amp; a hard case. the only time your checked luggage can be opened is in your presence. you are the only one with the key.

no fears of lost luggage or theft. losing a gun is a lot of paperwork for an airline.

you are the only one with a key to your bag

the tsa agents who do these searches are vets not newbies. they are looking for dangerous and illegal to fly with shit. pack your thc vape carts with some regular vape kit in with your toiletries. they literally don't have the time to give a shit &amp; are far more likely to question the damn batteries.

flare guns count as firearms per federal law. cheap marine ones can be had for $50. super good locks can be bought for $50-$100.

literally never worry about flying with personal quantities of anything that isn't flower again, along with having a far more pleasant screening experience, next to no chance of having things stolen from your bag, and a much greater chance of never having to deal with the hell that is a lost bag.

i don't own a gun nor do i feel the desire or need to.

i do have a second hand starter pistol bought for next to nothing simply to make flying slightly less awful.

money well fucking spent.

edit:

for the trust, but verify crowd...

/u/zer0cul 's reply links the video that first informed me of this. if interested i suggest watching it, the link to a fuller set of sources/tips/regulations is in the video description.

tsa regulations(https://www.tsa.gov/travel/transporting-firearms-and-ammunition)

as to flying internationally. it's easier than you would expect even to countries with stricter gun laws. you need to check the regulations on the state department's website of the country that you are traveling to for their rules - all vary and there is no tldr, suprisingly few countries prevent temporary importation if you intend to return with it and travel with no ammo... and the us customs &amp; border control website if you're an insane person who wants to travel with more than 3 firearms or more than 1000 rounds of ammunition.

also i misspoke - they only search your bag if it fails a swab or other basic clearance test. if unlike me you don't smoke a lot at home to the point where your baggage may pop you won't even be subjected to the hand search. tsa marks the tag clear. it's never opened until you retake possession of it at your destination.",UnethicalLifeProTips

3542, take advantage of large corporations greed,"     when entering a large scale business be aware of your surroundings. what do you see, if the answer is money you are on the right track. so here’s what you want to do. follow these steps and you will be walking away with cash in your pocket and a smile on your face. you must be asking can i get caught?! this is what i will explain. so here is the basic premise of this master mind of a plan i got going for you fine folks. 
       let me explain why this works and why large corporations. when our founding fathers discovered and built our country the principles and idea of human condition was fully developed and a large mobility was developed and thoroughly performed. large corporations do not change the importance of what the people need in a proper and disgusting form of what we think and what the people properly need.
     the meat and big portion of this plan is the mindset that is required and devotion to perform what is known as this method and metrology which can be actively criticized and counted as an alleviation of the truth. let me explain what we have here is something that many people can use on a daily basis and benefit from. and what do the people need the most? money! this method developed from the mind of the people can help develop and form what is known as success in life and happiness.
      on to the safety and concern of this plan. to answer the question of is this safe? the answer is simply this, if you do not wish to be caught than why choose to try and why choose to perform and develop the mind further in an active pursuit of the truth or what this method may cause. the outcome is not what matters but what is physically manifested to be in our pockets thoroughly and possibly the wallet. but then safety and trust which the human mind can perceive is quite remarkable as to which the consequences may flow through several perhaps databases or processed through a unique synchronization.
     alright if you stuck through to this part here is where the reward will certainly show. but first let me explain the reward system and how we can accomplish these seemingly menial tasks for the one goal. large corporations do not care about the wellbeing of a daily basis but certainly outcomes and inputs. to factor it down here is where we currently stand on a trivial scale. medium to mismatched height advantages can be the cause of corporate greed and which the local populace can take advantage of.
   if you have any questions please leave a comment, i have used this trick several times.
  one corporation is recorded stating “ it was a rat's nest. not a literal one, but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning when she got up. it was going to take at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it. she peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it. it wasn't. she opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers. “
  the main person behind this method actually said in his own words, josh had spent year and year accumulating the information. he knew it inside out and if there was ever anyone looking for an expert in the field, josh would be the one to call. the problem was that there was nobody interested in the information besides him and he knew it. years of information painstakingly memorized and sorted with not a sole giving even an ounce of interest in the topic. so what we can perceive here is basically he knew what he was supposed to do. that had been apparent from the beginning. that was what made the choice so difficult. what he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same. this would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences, but he wasn't.
    to conclude this long method spending time at national parks can be an exciting adventure, but this wasn't the type of excitement she was hoping to experience. as she contemplated the situation she found herself in, she knew she'd gotten herself in a little more than she bargained for. it wasn't often that she found herself in a tree staring down at a pack of wolves that were looking to make her their next meal.
  for final touches to make this method perfection i inadvertently went to see's candy last week (i was in the mall looking for phone repair), and as it turns out, see's candy now charges a dollar -- a full dollar -- for even the simplest of their wee confection offerings. i bought two chocolate lollipops and two chocolate-caramel-almond things. the total cost was four-something. i mean, the candies were tasty and all, but let's be real: a snickers bar is fifty cents. after this dollar-per-candy revelation, i may not find myself wandering dreamily back into a see's candy any time soon.

3548, request: how to gaslight my neighbours,"so before someone tells my about the immorality of my project; first of all the purpose of this subreddit is to share immoral things and second i have good reasons not to like them.

i'm living in a small flat in a house with 7 apartments in total, so it's not a big community. i moved in a year ago and since then the only neighbours i have contact with regularly are the ones this request is about. they are a couple, around 70 years old who are not working but still pretty fit. they live in a bigger flat downstairs and are the only ones that frequently use the little garden behind the house to bbq and drink beers. they are somehow strange but normally pretty ok. you may ask: ""why would you want to gaslight/harm them then?""

it's their music, i tell you. on an average of about 4 days a week at random times between 6am and 12pm, this 70 year old man starts blasting music on a sound system that is making the walls shake. and it's not just old-people music, their jams consist mostly of drum &amp; bass and trance, interrupted by schlager and things that sound like their grandchildren played it for them on a family get-together. it's horrible and mostly starts when i either was about to sleep or about to wake up, but even when that's not the case it is unbearable because of the sheer loudness. 

i've tried talking to them once, but since i'm still kinda young (19) they just told me to get over it and that i should be the one listening to too loud music. at this point i can't believe listening to music on that volume doesn't have any ""benefit"" for them (as they hear perfectly when i talk to them) and it's just to piss people off, but apparently nobody else in the house cares or is willing to talk to them about it.

since i now finally know that i'll move out in 2 months, i'm planning for revenge because i won't have to deal with them for long anymore anyways. my plan right now is to hide a sound module that plays a weird sound connected to a motion sensor somewhere in the garden to irritate them for at least some time, but i'm open for every good or bad idea on how to really gaslight them/make them go crazy even after i moved out.

thank you so much for all your unethical advice.

3591, how to stop a police investigation and get serious charges dropped ,"r/legal advice says i want unethical advice and they told me to post here

this is all hypothetical...

a close friend was in a shopping centre (it was shutdown for covid at the time) when police arrive to harass him, they demand a mandatory stop and search he proceeds to knock the officer to the floor unintentionally, as he has multiple illicit things in his bag. in the uk police are very active when it comes to seizing guns. so my friend decides to run and ends up being chased through a park by nearly a dozen officers, he is caught and is now getting a weapons charge amongst other things.

is there a way someone can be set up to take the fall for him ? they admit to forcing him to traffic weapons for them ? or something along those lines and if so how much can it mitigate the sentence ?

it was also discovered that a step brother (i’ll call him a) of my friend had been talking to the police so a group of my friends wanted to talk to him about it. a was confronted at his house and no one was acting aggressive towards him but a lashes out, hitting one of my friends. this was uncalled for so in self defence every one got involved in an altercation and he ended up being knocked to the floor and kicked a little bit

as it was all kicking of a friend decides to throw a substance a’s eyes (which would only burn and give temporary sight loss, no permanent damage) and they tell him at this point to not talk to the police etc and as he’s getting up someone hits him a few more times, he ends up getting burnt on his hand and he’s generally beaten a bit. so everyone’s a bit aggressive but not really “torture”

a’s friend was in the house but no one realised, he ended up calling police and jumping out a window (he was drunk so how can police believe anything he said, i don’t know). so police are suddenly kicking down the door and arresting everyone. they recovered some weapons and arrested a few people who didn’t manage to hop the fence.

assault or gbh but torture is a little excessive. the person who was assaulted has agreed to say it was just a misunderstanding and minor altercation that he provoked and no one else who was there will say anything

i basically just want to know how serious this is. will a torture charge hold up ? what’s the maximum/minimum sentence ? but mainly how can this be proven to just be an assault/gbh ? 

how frequently is minor bribery/blackmail of officials exposed ? is it difficult to prove if everyone was cautious ? i’m just curious as to how difficult it appears to be for the police to go back once they are corrupted as they can’t expose it without incriminating themselves and causing a scandal. which is a mistake on their behalf as it only grows and becomes more and obvious. 

i know how minor leverage led to an individual within the police resulted in him being used as a puppet. the police need to remover their officers are human because it’s too easy to find stuff to use against them (small stuff like minor drug use, affairs and incidents from their past) and once they complete one “favour” they have just further incriminated themselves. we are not involved in this of course just wanted to put out there how easily corruptible the police are despite much documentation on it. sorry that’s off topic... but does bribery just result in a fine if it’s not too serious ?

my final situation where i require advice is a gun was recovered in a house raid which is being linked to a shooting. no one was hurt in this shooting, someone let of shots at a car with no intention of harming anyone. just a distasteful joke and yes the culprit acknowledges it was irresponsible but it’s unreasonable that the police are saying “one of there many fear tactics to maintain control”. it’s laughable they portray us as some kind organised crime group, yes were a little reckless and irresponsible at times but were not some kind of “violent street gang”. 

so they can trace shootings to the weapon but how can they prove who carried out the shooting ? as weapons change hands a lot and the police can easily unjustly portray people as the culprits in a long list of shootings they had noting to do with

 police are unfairly labelling my friends as criminals and their throwing around the term “gang”. we’re really just a family or close friend group but of course the police are gonna try and exaggerate things and make us out to be some violent criminals and the media love contributing to the lies as well.

also this is from the uk, i’m 15 and my friends age from 15-17 and as a group the police have falsified a multitude of charges importing, distribution of all classes, laundering, gbh, firearms, witness intimidation, blackmail, theft and so many other ridiculous charges. it’s all been overly exaggerated or been made up entirely, we’re not violent what so ever and while we have been reckless at times what teenagers haven’t. they even have the audacity to make out we are in possession of large amount of drug money, it’s ridiculous i can’t stress enough that we are not career criminals or are a threat to the public in anyway.

how easy is it for police to seize money ? we have all the full documentation to show it’s legitimacy as we run legitimate businesses (buying and selling goods and artwork, also we employ younger kids from the estate to wash cars) and that is how we make money. we are young entrepreneurs that are having are efforts wrongly slandered. ask any local and they’ll tell you are businesses are legit.

finally i will add that after talking to a solicitor it’s believed that most drug related charges will be dropped and there is no grounds to take our money and most of us will not be convicted on any charges

as it was all kicking of a friend decides to throw a substance a’s eyes (which would only burn and give temporary sight loss, no permanent damage) and they tell him at this point to not talk to the police etc and as he’s getting up someone hits him a few more times, he ends up getting burnt on his hand and he’s generally beaten a bit. so everyone’s a bit aggressive but not really “torture”

a’s friend was in the house but no one realised, he ended up calling police and jumping out a window (he was drunk so how can police believe anything he said, i don’t know). so police are suddenly kicking down the door and arresting everyone. they recovered some weapons and arrested a few people who didn’t manage to hop the fence.

assault or gbh but torture is a little excessive. the person who was assaulted has agreed to say it was just a misunderstanding and minor altercation that he provoked and no one else who was there will say anything

i basically just want to know how serious this is. will a torture charge hold up ? what’s the maximum/minimum sentence ? but mainly how can this be proven to just be an assault/gbh ? 

how frequently is minor bribery/blackmail of officials exposed ? is it difficult to prove if everyone was cautious ? i’m just curious as to how difficult it appears to be for the police to go back once they are corrupted as they can’t expose it without incriminating themselves and causing a scandal. which is a mistake on their behalf as it only grows and becomes more and obvious. 

i know how minor leverage led to an individual within the police resulted in him being used as a puppet. the police need to remover their officers are human because it’s too easy to find stuff to use against them (small stuff like minor drug use, affairs and incidents from their past) and once they complete one “favour” they have just further incriminated themselves. we are not involved in this of course just wanted to put out there how easily corruptible the police are despite much documentation on it. sorry that’s off topic... but does bribery just result in a fine if it’s not too serious ?

my final situation where i require advice is a gun was recovered in a house raid which is being linked to a shooting. no one was hurt in this shooting, someone let of shots at a car with no intention of harming anyone. just a distasteful joke and yes the culprit acknowledges it was irresponsible but it’s unreasonable that the police are saying “one of there many fear tactics to maintain control”. it’s laughable they portray us as some kind organised crime group, yes were a little reckless and irresponsible at times but were not some kind of “violent street gang”. 

so they can trace shootings to the weapon but how can they prove who carried out the shooting ? as weapons change hands a lot and the police can easily unjustly portray people as the culprits in a long list of shootings they had noting to do with

 police are unfairly labelling my friends as criminals and their throwing around the term “gang”. we’re really just a family or close friend group but of course the police are gonna try and exaggerate things and make us out to be some violent criminals and the media love contributing to the lies as well.

also this is from the uk, i’m 15 and my friends age from 15-17 and as a group the police have falsified a multitude of charges importing, distribution of all classes, laundering, gbh, firearms, witness intimidation, blackmail, theft and so many other ridiculous charges. it’s all been overly exaggerated or been made up entirely, we’re not violent what so ever and while we have been reckless at times what teenagers haven’t. they even have the audacity to make out we are in possession of large amount of drug money, it’s ridiculous i can’t stress enough that we are not career criminals or are a threat to the public in anyway.

how easy is it for police to seize money ? we have all the full documentation to show it’s legitimacy as we run legitimate businesses (buying and selling goods and artwork, also we employ younger kids from the estate to wash cars) and that is how we make money. we are young entrepreneurs that are having are efforts wrongly slandered. ask any local and they’ll tell you are businesses are legit.

finally i will add that after talking to a solicitor it’s believed that most drug related charges will be dropped and there is no grounds to take our money and most of us will not be convicted on any charges

parents are these kind of people you can not argue with, so i'm thinking about ways to make them stop making noises all day, i work from home, my girlfriend had anxiety problems and this is driving us mad.

as a plus to this, the next door neighbourg had a teenager daughter and some days she (single mother) left the daughter alone, so she use to spend all night at the rooftop with about 10, 15 people drinking until the morning. that nights is imposible to sleep.

is specially disgusting, because their house covers half the rooftop and mine is the other half, they can just stay at is part, but you know, some people is shit.

i want something to make them avoid my side of the rooftop. i think that maybe some broken bottles will do the trick, but i'm not sure that will work, also kids may cut, as parents are assholes and probably will care not about what they grab, or where they step in.

3610, request: getting fed up with loud neighbors..how to fuck with them anonymously,"my husband and i have been renting a home for almost 3 years now and have been plagued with the worst backyard neighbors i've ever dealt with in my life. they are severe alcoholics who party all night several times a week, blasting loud music over a speaker, screaming at the top of their lungs, yelling at their kids, dogs barking.. all until 2am or later on weekdays and weekends. 

no this is not some frat house this is a grown ass man with a wife and kids who seems to think he runs the neighborhood and doesn't give a fuck that the whole street is forced to listen to him every night. 

last night was especially bad with music and screams roaring past 1am. it's a weeknight, which means for my husband and i, hardworking young professionals, we have to work in the morning. it's fair weather in our area, and we should be allowed to open some windows for some fresh air undisturbed.

we called the cops, twice. the sound never died down. the lady on dispatch promised us after the second call around midnight that someone would be out there soon. 2 hours later and the party still continues. 

this isn't the first time cops have been called and nothing happened. we also called to report them for parties during covid restrictions. our area had a limit of 5 people per gathering and i counted over 10 different heads and voices multiple nights during lockdown. how is that fair to all of us staying in??

  these mother fuckers are causing arguments between my husband and i now, loss of sleep and i'm officially pissed. i've spent 2 years saying shit like ""who cares"" ""mind your own buisness "" ""let them have their fun"" to my husband but i'm done. we are in our twenties and do not drink and party whatsoever. we live simple, quiet lives. i would like to be able to spend time with my dogs on our patio undisturbed for once. 

so i'm looking for anonymous ways to fuck with them as i'm done with the ethical route. i must admit i was having some dark ass thoughts last night of poisoning their dogs or calling cps on them or throwing dog shit in their pool or slashing their tires.. none of this i plan on doing i'm just pissed. i also don't want to get in a ""who can make more noise "" war either. these people could hop my fence at any time and retaliate if they knew it was us.

3620,: learn how to be a better liar,"some people are notoriously bad liars. you should know how to lie properly, don’t be nervous, follow these steps.

- the other person does not have all the information you have. the so called “theory of mind” is the ability to attribute mental states e.g knowledge to others. when we learn how to lie, around the age of 2, some people become better at it as years go by while others tend to forget this fact. so keep in mind... the person your lying to does not know the same facts as you do, and even if it’s theoretically possible that they do, they most likely don’t.

- use truth to associate your lies with. the “mnemonical” system of our brains prefers to have associations to remember things. you’ll have troubles keeping a fully made up story in your head, but you’ll be able to keep a “remade” story in your head. e.g. tell her you’ve been at work late to finish the report and then you saw a bird lay eggs outside the window. only you were at work late to fuck your male colleague in the asshole. the story about the report and eggs is in fact a memory you have from another day. if she ever asks you about the eggs and if they’ve hatched, you can honestly say they haven’t/have, because that part is true. and if she ever talks about the late reports, that’s also true only it wasn’t that day. as soon as a lie becomes a question about dates and details, it’s much less likely to be exposed.

- if it’s a tough lie, put in something embarrassing. humans tend to see that as opening up, and they get a feeling of truth from it. are you late because you slept in? tell them you had diarrhea due to something you ate. that’s cringe to tell someone openly, and they won’t question it.",UnethicalLifeProTips

3631," request uk: i need a bit of inspiration for dealing with a spoilt ritch kid who threatened to ""f*** my kids""","  


first up, first thing i did was call the police.

  


its pretty bloody hot here at the moment so all our windows are open and for two hours up to midnight i could hear loud music and yelling. it might have been about football but i'm not sure, anyway, the party was ongoing, on a wednesday night.

  


like a good brit i checked the website of the local council to find out how to deal with noise complaints and the result was: knock on their door and try to sort out our in a neighbourly way. it was 12:15 at night when i found the offending address, a very large country manor house with huge flood lights and no buzzer so i crunched loudly down the drive and to the source of the noise, the pool house.

  


i knocked on a window but no answer so i made myself known round the front and asked them to go inside and stop the noise.

  


the 4 18-20 year old residents split between apologies, threats, and filming for instagram (seems like nice evidence if it was posted). the apparent ""owner"" of the house (but unless he was a premier league footballer, it was definitely daddy's house) was very angry, raised his fists and said, ""i'll f\*in knock you out"" and ""i'll f\*\*\* your kids"".

  


the two that weren't filming tried to apologize and very drunkenly took me off to one side and said they would sort it out.

  


i called the police about the threats but i am almost certain that nothing will come of it.

  


i know i shouldn't have gone round now but there was nothing else to do except ""raise a noise pollution incident"" during office hours with the local council.

3640,get free ($60) games from console purchases from walmar,"so i did this awhile ago in 2014, don’t know if things still work the same but. you know how consoles are usually packaged with games? well there’s usually a code printed out on a card in the box that can be redeemed online. in 2014 i had saved up money and already had a pc but wanted a console so i said “f it” i bought an xbox one. it was okay but really not up to the hype tbh. i forgot how long i had it maybe a week or two? i think the game it came with was a titan fall 1? the game came on a card with a code, put the code in and added the game to my xbox live account. walmart is usually unhealthily lenient with refunds with the amount of lp leeway they give (stealing is still bad). so titanfall was on my account. everything is back in the box, drive to walmart, return it, they ask what’s wrong, there’s nothing wrong with it it works fine just didn’t feel it was a worthwhile purchase for the price (had a 360 anyway). i get home and hop on my 360 after some time, i look at my xbox live account and see titanfall is still on it, as it’s a digital product so it’s linked to the account. can’t play it since it’s an xbox one version but it was still a $60 game. so i basically got a free game. don’t know if this still works and i’m sure some others know the trick but hey there you go.

tldr; buy a console that comes with a game, keep or use the code that comes with the console, return it to the store that has an open box policy like walmart, walk away with a free game for a console you don’t have. or just take out the insides of the console and leave the shell, but that’s fraud. i’m not your mother or father.",UnethicalLifeProTips

usps retail for padded is $8.40 per label where i am. with this i am only paying $7.15 per label. it adds up.

i made a bunch of different ais, but today i improved my strategy and built ais that have context from your existing conversation and tries to communicate conversationally rather than as a question-asnwering type chat.


the best news?


i built this particular one on the ricky gervais show featuring steve merchant and karl pilkington - all the transcripts i could find ;)


http://jare.cloud/the-ricky-gervais-show-featuring-steve-merchant-and-karl-pilkington-chat-bot/


i built this one to flirt with you regardless of the time of day, or such stresses common folk have like headaches or being toooo tired...


http://jare.cloud/sexy-flirt-bot/


i built this one to reference only banned books by the likes of chomsky or dozens of banned books on the occult or current situations....


http://jare.cloud/banned-books-bot/


(note that the last 2 are being re-trained from acting as question-answering bots to being more conversational bots that have context from the last messages as we speak :) be about 5 more hours before they're live-worthy....)


this one simply draws it's wealth of knowledge from a subsection of reddit posts, and is probably the most likely to beat the turing test of all of them:

3702, request: creating a fake it company to lie about work experience.,"so i am one among thousands of university graduates stuck in the catch 22 of work experience (need experience to get a job but need a job to have experience) and because i dont want to do unskilled labour for minimum wage for the rest of my life in spite of having a bachelors degree in programming, i figured this plot might be the way to success. i guess the worst that can happen is that i just wont get hired, so nothing will change.  


a lot of it companies are unwilling to hire graduates/inexperienced people because they see it as a waste of their money to train up someone, even if that person is perfectly capable of learning everything required. they will sometimes even go as far to not hire someone that does have the required skill set because they dont have prior employment.  
there is also an issue with the amount of absurd demands for positions that really dont justify them, such as asking for a masters degree for a job that pays maybe 30% than the minimum wage.   


so ive decided it would be a good idea to create a fake defunct company and lie about working there, to help me and my friends find work easier. the chinese virus gives a convenient excuse for saying that the company is bankrupt and doesnt exist any more.  
however i am thinking what should be done to 'legitimise' this company and make it seem real.  
some things i came up with:

\- create a fake website that talking a bit of shit about some made up projects, or maybe just a big pop up that says ""we went out of business"".  
\- maybe a linkedin/other social media page with a similar message.   
\- perhaps some contact details pointing to an email i operate  
\- claim the company existed in a foreign, non english speaking country to make it harder to validate  


not sure at the moment what else could be done, what ideas do you guys have? i live in the uk, so bonus points if you know something specifically british that might help.  
to my knowledge its not illegal to make up companies that dont exist, and lying on your cv is at worst unethical.

basically these are older men who spend thousands of dollars on these international dating sites, thinking they are talking to a pretty blond ukrainian/russian girl, while in reality it might not be true as the women usually don't video chat with them, they don't want to give them any other contact like social media or whatsapp, saying that they don't speak english very well and are shy (because obv they're making money from the paid website)

in the show 90df, the men come to their countries and the women just ghost them, or tell them they will meet them and then just don't show up, give them false address etc etc.

3708,: call child protective services on yourself for a much needed break from your children!,"are you exhausted by your children? call child protective services on yourself for a nice needed break.

kids can be exhausting. trust me, i know. my toddler just finished throwing wooden alphabet puzzle pieces at me screaming i want a treat. i’m sure many of you can relate, and everyone deserves a break. here’s how to get your life back to the good old days so you can have a coffee and take a break whenever you want. it’s simple. 

call child protective services on yourself for an offence that would have your children taken away from you. when they show up, make sure you’ve got some evidence planted so that cps takes immediate action. maybe you put them in the dogs kennel, right when cps shows up, maybe you make a line of baking soda on the coffee table and rub some on your nose so it looks like your in the middle of a coke sesh — i don’t care, just make it look like you’re and awful person. 

cps will take your kids and put them in a loving family! and just like that, you’ll get your life back! and your kids get to meet new and interesting people. the best part is, you’ll still get to see your kids for visitations!! so you get to take it easy most of the time, and still be in their lives. 

it gets even better, since when they are a ward of the state, the state will pay for things like their clothes, and their new family will pay for food!!! that’s more money in your pocket!!!! who doesn’t want more money?! 

when your ready for you kids back, show cps you’ve changed! since the reason the kids were taken was made up, it will be easy! then voila, you get your kids back! alls well that ends well, right? 

in summary, you get your old life back, you get to drink coffee in peace, you don’t have to pay for your kids anymore!! and you get them back eventually once you’re ready. it’s a win-win-win-win-win!

anyway, we’ve argued about it. i was sleep deprived last time i called him about ignoring my service request and putting a passive aggressive note on it saying i “refused to open the door” when he came 5 hours before the appointment time i asked for, with handymen not certified technicians. he lies and says the are but they have no equipment to work on the thing, literally touched a pipe and said it was cold so it must be fine. i asked the manager for their certification number and he said he doesn’t have it... as their boss. this was this week. he hung up on me during that conversation. i don’t swear at him or anything but i was obviously angry in my tone and i can’t even have my dog at home bc he’s a bulldog and can’t handle the heat. i’m honestly worried if they ever try to actually fuck with it they’ll break the thing and somehow he’ll try to charge me for it. i know i could take him to court but i don’t have the time for that nor the willpower to do anything but deal with finding a new lease while i hope it doesn’t stop running again. i could send a letter saying im ending the lease but then where will i go..

my lease ends next month and i want to leave now. the problem is that there is obviously sourness between me and the property manager. i so far have provided a very politically correct explanation for the above to one landlord and she hasn’t gotten back to me since, despite being very responsive previously. 

i want to omit this all together but i know that my previous address is provided in background and credit checks and that inconsistency in my application is a red flag. from what i’ve read it can take up to 30 days to remove a previous address from a credit report after changing all your lenders billing addresses and i don’t have that time. it’s also a complex so if i give a wrong number and they happen to look up the place they’ll see a different number. only one person works at the office so no one else would answer the phone.

3770,: how i make passive income using the free electricity access i have at my workplace.,"not sure if this is more illegal or unethical. i suppose you can get fired but i am unsure if they can sue you.

where i work, i have my own desk in a rather secluded area of the building. we do shifts so most of the times i am alone in my room. some alone time is required to set this trick – take advantages of the pandemic going on to request you work different shifts and have that alone time too, like i did.

first:

1) if you have a pc, you can most likely sell your unused computing power. i use a combo of ougo browser and loadteam. google them to know more about how they work – one is basically a referral browser and the other is a passive app that uses your cpu power. between the two of them i make around £1.60 a day, which doesn’t sound like much but it’s a free deliveroo every week, or your spotify / netflix / prime paid… without having to move a single finger.

2) the “big” bucks comes from cryptocurrency mining. this is something that is never recommended for a reason, it is not profitable against the price of electricity. however, if you have the time and knowledge to set this up in an office space where the electricity is free… this is a real possibility.

i have hidden in my bottom drawer 3 antminer i bought 6 months ago, on the used market, for a fraction of the price. the guy was selling them after realizing he made a loss. they profit me around £8.70 a day, which is basically the hourly minimum wage, but it’s also £261 a month, or in 5 month it’s £1300 which the price of an expensive pc for gaming or top graphic card… for free!

i would have bought more of those miners but i have only three plugs i can use without people thinking i am doing more than charging my phone and devices. plus, those machines heats like radiators so you want to give them proper spacing.

i set them up in my bottom drawer, and i undid the cover on the back of the drawers to give them proper ventilation.

so to recap, between the two i am able to net around £10/day, or £300/month. not bad but it requires an initial investment of time and some money.

i have been doing this for 8 months and so far no one ever noticed anything. people even used my desk and didn’t see/noticed anything.",UnethicalLifeProTips

i live on the ground floor of a building; my apartment comes with a small backyard, front yard, and a garage. my parents bought the place in the 80s, and they used the place as a summer house, however, we recently moved here permanently.

3 of our neighbors had their water tanks installed in our backyards, the water pressure used to be very weak, so everyone had water tanks on the ground with water motors and another on the roof of the building, however, now the pressure is much much better and there's no need for such arrangements anymore. so my parents asked everyone to remove their tanks, and 2 of 3 neighbors did so.

we asked our neighbor several times to remove his tank off of our property with no luck. my parents are tired of this and they are very non-confrontational so they just let is go. moreover, we live in a very shitty country, so there's no association or council to refer to in these kinds of disputes.

i want this thing destroyed in a semi-natural way so i won't get in trouble with my parents or neighbors, as they are a-holes. they do not use it or need it anymore, its market value is probably below zero (factoring removal costs) and it is not on our property. just a piece of junk lying around.

the cashier was always more focused on checking that it was in fact a real id and not a fake that they either didn't read the birthday because they assumed no one is stupid enough to try to use an id that straight up says theyre underage, or they just forgot to check.  i even had one clerk ask what my birthday was because they thought it was fake and that i wouldn't be able to remember the date on the id.  i just said my real birthday and i guess they didn't second guess it and sold me my booze anyways.

this worked about 90% of the time and even when it didn't work, its not like they can keep your real id.  so just go to the next store and try again.

3913, - today i took my first proctored exam. tried to cheat. am i going to get flagged for how i did i,"before anyone berates me for doing it - i have a lot on my plate. both personally and educationally. 2020 beat me up! so if i pass this exam, i’m exempt from the final and i can worry about passing my other classes.


how i did it:

attached short papers on top of my laptop screen, taped behind it so they stood up. each were a,b,c, and d. i can see them from my peripheral so i don’t have to divert my eyes. 

i scanned the room like the proctor asked and took the test. however, my sister silently came up behind my laptop to quietly look up the questions and tell me which answer they are by pointing at one of the papers.

the thing im worrying about is reading the questions and answers aloud to myself. like, almost all of them. 50 questions. i tried to make them seem as natural as possible since my sister is tech inept.... it was honestly rly stressful that couldn’t find any answer for me but i still am thankful for her effort. 

she also was flailing her arms to get my attention but couldn’t understand that i cannot divert my eyes. but i did, at least twice. i also looked down to type on my phone for a few seconds bc she wasn’t getting it. but after that, i showed the camera that i’m turning off my phone since an alarm went off. 

my eyes were on the screen about 95% of the time. i also got up to turn on the light since it was getting dark out. i’m not sure if me talking will get flagged. but it felt weird to read all q’s and a’s aloud. sometimes repeatedly. but i tried to make it seem like i couldn’t focus unless i read aloud.

wondering if anyone has tried this method and wasn’t flagged! i have so many essays to do, and i’m dealing with a lot of recent trauma. also got fired last week. i couldn’t focus or have time to study for this exam. it’s just a lot and i normally wouldn’t put myself or my sister through that much trouble.

i also talked to myself like “omg i’m running out of time” so i’m not sure if that’s unusual as i actually usually talk to myself.

do you think i’m safe? or am i fucked?

please help. thank you!",UnethicalLifeProTips

3963, how to use a legal loophole to get away with murder,"in the 50 square miles of yellowstone national park which fall inside of idaho, theoretically a criminal could get away with any crime.

say you’re on a family vacation, enjoying the scenery and suddenly, you decide to murder someone.

the park’s official location is wyoming so if you’re arrested, that’s where you’ll be taken to be tried.

but here’s the first part of the loophole: the constitution states that trials must be held in the same state the crime was committed in.

obviously, you exercise your constitutional right and so you are taken back to idaho.

so the government starts to assemble a trial. all is going well until some know-it-all remembers the sixth amendment which states you are entitled to an “impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.”

only, the state you’re in is technically wyoming, but the district you’re in? oh yeah, that’s idaho.

your jury needs to specifically comprise of people who live in the idaho section of yellowstone.

and here’s the kicker: absolutely no one lives there.

it’s federal land. no one is actually allowed to live there.

unless you’re feeling generous and allow them to try you in wyoming, you can’t be tried at all.

3964,: how to exploit the poor for money,"american and british cigarette manufacturers have been selling single cigarettes to children in third world countries and also distributing them free to very young poor children in order to set establish junior dealer networks rather similar to the methods used by illicit drugs dealers. you can go to poor countries and sell cigarettes after getting them hooked. 

corporations in both countries (and many others) exploit child labor overseas in manufacturing industries (clothing for example). you can invest in any company that does this. for an example, you could buy shares of apple. 

cigarettes are generally promoted to poor peoples because they may be more receptive to the aspirational images promoted by excessive advertising by very rich corporations. you can buy shares in both the cigarette manufacturers and their contracted advertising agencies.

junk food is promoted to poorer people in the west because it is cheap, if lacking nutrition, some people have suggested that low vitamin high fat/high sugar food is addictive and looking at the shape of poorer westerners i’m inclined to agree.

buy shares in junk food restaurants, warren buffet has been doing this for years.

poor people are exploited financially as a result of extraordinarily high rates of interest which they are charged on loan agreements, in particular, consumer credit.

credit card companies will purport that the exorbitant high interest rates represent a risk premium, it is the de facto poor person’s premium.

the very wealthiest get to accumulate assets at a rate of interest close to zero %, they get to borrow almost free money, then buy leveraged assets to greatly increase returns.

the poor don’t get leveraged returns, only liabilities.

consumer credit is marketed at poor people in order to make spending appear easy, to make them momentarily feel richer, however, credit cards serve to make them poorer of course and usually forever in debt, they become hooked, rather like the victims of the cigarette manufacturers and fast food joints, you see the common theme here?…………dependancy.

buy shares in the banks and finance companies that issue credit cards at the highest rates to the poorest in society.

the poor become addicted or dependant before they can work out just what is happening to them. most of them are not taught this in school so they are ripe for exploitation. so get poor people hooked on drugs then sell to them!

lottery companies sell dreams of extreme wealth for a $ dollar, cigarette manufacturers sell images of sex appeal or success, fast food restauranteurs are selling happiness in family groups filling their stomachs with dirt cheap food. again, buy shares in all those companies and resell lottery tickets.

the poor want what they can’t have. the rich are happy to sell them dreams of what poor people think it is that will make them feel rich. this is what you want to exploit, get creative!

to continue the theme, you could open a church or mosque, poor people are exploited further in paying for their spiritual dependancy, at great cost over their lifetimes, keeping them ever poorer, even less in control of their wretched lives as a result.

if you can’t be bothered with any of this, the lazy way to exploit the poor is to simply vote republican.

if you can’t bring yourself to vote republican then give your vote to the democrats, the tune is different but the net result is the same, the poor are exploited, the poor get ever poorer and income inequality widens exponentially.

4086,: need a streaming service free? prepaid cards to the rescue!,"if you ever want a streaming service for free and you don't mind using the free trial, then use this.

most free trials for streaming services require that you put in a valid credit/debit card so that they can autocharge you once the free trial is up.

buy a prepaid visa or mastercard card from your local walmart/target/whatever and put the minimum amount on it. usually the minimum is $20. use $10 or $15 from the card, just make the balance on the card less than the price of the streaming service. some services will charge the card $1 or possibly more and then refund it to make sure the card is not empty or fake.

get a throwaway email and sign up for the streaming service with the card. it will give you the free trial, and once the trial is up repeat the process except buying the card. if you use a new email address after the trial is up, you should be able to use the same card.

i did this myself a few weeks ago when i wanted to watch picard on cbs all access, but i didn't want to watch any of their other shows. worked like a charm and since the card had less than the price it wasn't billed. i also picked their highest plan with no ads for the trial.

but apart from bad memes, you can also find some questionable posts.this is basically how celebrities are getting exposed, by ppl digging up their old tweets (example: keving heart making gay jokes in 2011 that lost him the opportunity to host the oscars), only fb is even older than that!

4116,: take advantage of current restaurant pandemic streamlining for free meals,"(only use this on corporate eateries please) 
so i've been trying to make ends meet and doing deliveries with apps like postmates. it has come to my attention that big corporate eateries have streamlined their pickup for delivery in response to the pandemic. i'm posting this for folks that really need a meal so here goes.

during peak hours it's all hands on deck for the restaurant. they typically have set up several tables with displays for all the delivery apps. they place the packaged food here for us drivers to pick up without any contact with their staff. they're busy doing orders so they won't pay you any attention not that they usually do.


all you need is to look like a delivery driver. that means buying a hot storage bag with an app logo, a facemask, and gloves. enter the building and you will find signs for delivery drivers. simply find any bag and read the name on it quickly in case they ask you for the name order. pop it into your hot bag and walk out. most of the time the staff doesn't even look at me walk in. plus you have a mask on so cctv can only do so much. 


occasionally i get asked to show my app when picking up during slow times. if you are ever asked for your app simply tell the staff that your so/friend has the app on their phone that's waiting outside in the car so you won't get a ticket. it's common for people to duo a delivery with a friend just to chat and prevent tickets. simply fuck off and move on to the next joint.


if you decide to do this please hit up big corporate restaurants only because all the small businesses are hemorrhaging and can't afford this tip.",UnethicalLifeProTips

4121,: use loudish sounds to scare a cat.,"if your cat has a habit of going into the washer/dryer/fridge/etc, let them go in (allow them to walk in by themselves, don't force them in there), close the door, and bang the top/side of the appliance a few times then open the door and let the cat bolt out. 

the banging noise would spook the cat and they ""immediately"" learn not to get too close to appliances. (sometimes it doesn't work though or some cats need to be scared 2-3 times, so congrats on traumatising your cat.)

some of you will downvote/complain about animal cruelty) but sometimes, scaring them once or twice is better than having a sly kitty getting stuck inside and potentially dying. of course, you can train them but some cats can be a-holes and forgo positive training for a warm place (ie: dryer) to lie in.",UnethicalLifeProTips

have you got some book titles that give instructions, in a diligent manner, on how to do unethical/blatantly illegal things? i like to read about such things and unfortunately have trouble finding such books. i am not talking here about books such as ""48 laws of power"" or ""rules for radicals"" but rather about complete, detailed analysis of a single, concrete topic. 

ideally it should fit these criteria:

\-written by an intelligent and educated author, based on facts and data instead of ""jessy pinkman logic"",

\-gives detailed instructions on what to do, what the common pitfalls are, how to not get caught etc

\-focused clearly on the topic instead of some bs opinions or judgements that the author may or may not have.

i've searched for books about blackmail, extortion, fraud etc and to my disappointment there aren't almost any at all. even when it comes to books written for detectives on investigating these topics, i've found very little.

the syllabus states that assignments over 5 days late will not be accepted ""without a robust discussion between the instructor and student."" i haven't turned in anything since the first week so without a hail mary of an excuse, i'm kinda fucked.

my best idea so far is to fake having gone to rehab (i realize that's pretty fucked up and i've had close friends deal w/ addiction). it would explain the absence for several weeks and substance/alcohol abuse is high since shelter in place orders. i'm not sure what would make it believable to a teacher and if they would check somehow. i can photoshop proof but am not sure what proof would seem legitimate. i also worry that the instructor could send me to a person that deals with special health cases at the community college. the teacher doesn't seem too strict and i feel like community college rules are usually more relaxed. i plan to submit all the work and then send the fake explanation because i figure that would increase my odds.

 “go in and get all the booze and go to the counter and also ask for a bag of ice. if they don’t card you, you are home free. if they do say you forgot your id but you’d still like the ice and you’ll be back for the booze. i figure they’d see this more as an honest mistake then a kid trying to illegally buy booze”. i forgot the user who specifically said it but all credit should go to him.  

what makes this risk free is that since we are in the middle of a pandemic i am sure the deli owners would not bother calling the cops. and even if they do make you go back home to get your id, you could just leave and not come back. checking the camera and trying to identify you would be to much of a hassle even without the pandemic going on. so what do you guys think?

i am very familiar with this scam and fortunately have not been trapped by it, but i'm wondering if anyone has any good tips or tricks for messing back with them?

4380, request need help ruining roommate/family friends life,"&amp;#x200b;

ok so long story short a few months ago this girl, let’s call her b, who was my best friend baxk then came to live in my house because she wasn’t getting on with her brother at her house.

&amp;#x200b;

we spent most of our last year at school together because of this, going to loads of parties together, going to school together etc etc, and it was great because i loved her and we got on so well, and it was purely platonic as well.

&amp;#x200b;

during this time i got a girlfriend, and my girlfriend started to hate our living sitatuon, and soon i started to dislike b because of this, and also because of over exposure.  we started to argue more on the way to school or at home and it became a very volatile relationship, 

&amp;#x200b;

i had many problems with her attitude, she never helped around the house, was super antisocial in the house, but at school was a massive attention seeker, she’d throw anyone including me under the bus for social gain, she’d be super closed minded about certain topics and i ended up hating her.

&amp;#x200b;

fast forward to now as this isn’t r/relationships, it’s quarantine, she’s here, i absolutely despise her literally everything she does i despise, and she most likely won’t leave until october when universities start up.

so this is where i would like help,

i want to make her life as unhappy as possible, i never want to see her socialise with my family, or anything at all.

i used to mac filter her ip so she wouldn’t get our wifi, which was quite funny until it meant she’d always be watching tv.

so i’d like any help, ideas to get her out my house (my parents love her unfortunately even tho i’ve told them how i feel) or just to make her unhappy as fuck,

• make sure you’re applying for a lower level or mid level job. a job that you can easily obtain with an actual 1-2 year job experience. 

• when you make you’re résumé. add a fake employer (that went out of business), or a place that actually went out business. this ensures that no one can confirm that you worked at that job. (most employers will give you the benefit of the doubt, and still consider/hire you). if they ask for a professional reference. you have the excuse that the job went out of business, and you do not have a way of contacting your former employer. 

• lastly. do your research on the position you will be in. look up anything you can to be knowledgeable. the interview will be the hardest part. make sure the skills for the job are actually within you’re grasp. if you do get hired you don’t want to be absolutely lost. if you are; they will not hesitate on firing you, or forcing you to quit.

4429, request: software client doesn't want to pay me for my work,"hi, 

background: 

i just started out as a web development freelancer from past december. till then, i used to work in a startup as a full stack developer. so when i started out, i spoke to several of my friends and colleagues asking for any referrals. it just so happened that one of my friends who also runs a web development agency had a client who wanted an application developed for his business which couldn't be taken up by my friend's agency since their plate was already full.

 long story short, the 3 of us spoke over a call and confirmed the project, but no mention of the cost at that point. later over successive calls, me and the client had discussions on the requirements. and at the end of those sessions i came out the initial architecture and a work flow and stated the budget (~ 5 lakhs inr/ 6.6k usd) to him to which he agreed and then work commenced (beginning of january). at this point of time i didn't have any written agreement or legal document drafted for the work. i assumed trust since he was already a good client according to my friend. 

skipping into two months of delivering nearly 70% percent of the application and also after making drastic changes or more accurately improvements to the initial model, i never demanded any payment (i know this is one the most dumbest mistakes that i've ever made). one day i happened to talk to my previous employer, who enquired about my current work and on hearing i haven't been paid upto that point, advised me that i talk to the client and draft a legal agreement asap. 

so i contacted my family lawyer and asked him to draft an agreement on my behalf. i called the client and let him know of the same. it was at this point the client began to slowly avoiding any talks about payments (i was still actively developing the application up until then which was around early march)

the problem:

since he kept dodging all my attempts to talk about either the agreement or the payment, i start losing my patience and stated to him that to proceed further on the work that he sign the agreement first and pay a part of the sum for work done up until then (~ 85%). to this he demanded that i complete the work and deliver, and he would settle the dues in full. at this point it was blatant that he was not in good faith. so, i refused his offer and requested him to sign the agreement and pay the dues. 

he has since been avoiding contact, so i contacted my friend (the one who referred) and informed him about the situation. the client has claimed to my friend that i had delivered nothing of value till then so he was willing to pay only 20k inr (~270 usd) for the whole project. and also he had lied a lot on the work (like the punctuality of my delivery etc.). 

when my friend sent me screenshots of the conversation, i was shattered. i put nearly 3 full months of hard work and built up the application from the ground up. i also realised i had been stupid enough to trust a stranger just because he was a friend's client. 

the real problem is that since it's been a complete lockdown here in india, my family who's running a small business went out of work and my sibling has to pay his college fee. 

up until this point i had enough to pay off my student loan and manage my expenses. now the little savings which i had has been nearly exhausted and i'm without an income. 

at this point i really can't expect help from my parents too, i'm stuck up in a really awful position. but i own the mistakes that i made. 

can anyone suggest any ideas please? 

tl; dr: had an order for an application from client for a fixed price, to which i failed to make a legal agreement. now, after nearly completing the work the client is offering to pay only a very small fraction of the originally agreed sum.",UnethicalLifeProTips

i just called my cc company and they couldnt do anything, but they provided a number for disputes (theyre closed for today). is there something i can say that will work? money is tight as a student, and $120 is a lot. the payment hasn't gone throught (its pending) so i

4449, request: need to set a trap for a thieving coworker,"i apologize for the long story, but the level of scumbaggery weaponized by the anonymous weasel fucker(s) in question goes beyond your routine break room sandwich grab and must be punished. i am out for blood (not really [but kind of]). i come to you, my devious friends, in my hour of need. please, help me exact justice.

i work as a caregiver at a group home for the intellectually disabled. we're talking wheelchairs, nonverbal diagnoses, the works. there are about 8 staff, including myself. 

look, i'm a reasonable guy. couple rolls of tp go missing, i'm not gonna lose sleep over it. box of gloves gone, not a big deal. pens disappear like a stoner pocketing lighters, whatever. i don't even care if the food gets eaten - the company pays for it and there's still plenty for everyone.

the problem is that the theft is getting brazen, and it's especially insulting because (a) there's this pandemic on, and on a more aggravating note, (b) most of these things stolen are the resident's possessions or purchases, so we're talking about the kind of rat dick(s) who would steal from disabled elderly folk. 

here's an incomplete list of things that have mysteriously evaporated from the house: cologne, cleaning products, shampoo, dvds, a dvd *player*, a handful of stuffed toys, board games, dishes, tupperware, medications, clothes, shoes, a stereo, wipes, markers, stationary, a goddamn $300 steam mop that we (used to) clean walls with, and an entire 12 pack of tp (when it was our last one! during a pandemic! the fucking managers locked it up after that and made us track our inventory with a naroctics record sheet for fuck's sake). even money taken out of a coworkers purse. shit is fucked.

after one staff confided in me that the entire ream of photo paper she bought with her own money (which was to print out pictures to make into a memory board for a resident who passed away last year) went missing, that was the last straw. that photo paper was almost $50 and they do not pay us enough to be generous like that. homegirl donated that shit because she cared enough to go out of her way to honor a sweet old lady and maybe five pictures got printed out of the 50 pages. 

reporting these thefts gets us nowhere. the management is largely incompetent and refuses to take any effective action without there being clear proof of a culprit. not only that, but some of the staff have been here for years and are comfortably entrenched in the company, and if any of them are responsible (hell, they may all be), it's going to make my life difficult if i pin the blame on one of them without knowing for sure. 

so i'm thinking of setting a trap of some kind. maybe buy some extra bottles of shampoo and have one of the ""reserve"" bottles filled with nair. swap the cologne in a bottle with cat pee. something that will make it obvious that they took a thing from the house they weren't supposed to, but that won't hurt a resident by mistake. i'd love to hear some creative solutions on the matter. how do i make this bastard pay",UnethicalLifeProTips

my neighbor moved in a little over a year ago, and since then he's being nothing but awful. he's this middle-aged white dude we're all sure does crack. he picks fights with neighbors, and constantly walks and talks like he's a ghetto black dude looking for trouble.i'm pretty sure everyone on the block hates him. i don't think he even has a job?? he lives with his partner (wife?) and daughter(?) and the daughter's child, who is a toddler.

1. he has a **confederate flag** and a hanging **noose** as a decoration in his backyard. (we're in california, this isn't normal or really socially acceptable)
2. i was outside one day and he and his partner were fighting *again* and then i hear him shouting, *""she hit me first! she hit me first! she hit me first!""* and you can guess what happened. they constantly fight. there was an argument because he made the toddler cry and wouldn't own up to it and blamed it on the toddler.
3. blares shitty country-rap crossovers all day. (when it's just my mom outside he blasts it loud, but when i come outside to visit my mom he turns down his music, assumably to eavesdrop)
4. lights illegal fireworks in the street (we live right next to an elementary school, the kindergarten classroom i attended is right behind his backyard!)
5. brought cockroach-infested wood from a collapsed tree into his yard and lights **bonfires.**
6. he has a massive ego over his shitty landscaping in his front yard, constantly standing in the middle of the street supposedly to get a better look, but also being nosy in our yard.
7. he kept peaking into our yard, my mom had to put up slats in the tiny fence gaps to keep him from peaking through the fence. just two weeks ago my mom noticed the slats kept coming undone like someone was pushing them, and she put up one of those window alarms that beeps when the sensor is moved. lo and behold, i'm woken up one morning by him fucking with our fence and pushing one of the slats out and the alarm going off. even when caught in the act, he told my mom ""i was just checking to see what the noise was"".
8. broke my mom's favorite tree because the branch was leaning into his driveway about 4 inches. he didn't ask my mom to trim it or do something about it, he just. broke it. just snapped the branch by bending it back into our yard. ""my side"" he said. (i think he wants to feel like he has authority on plants and landscaping, like he knows more than anyone about landscaping)
9. he was cutting my mom's plant, too. i mean, trimming it off on your side is one thing, but we caught him cutting off branches of this flowering shrub on his side/the top, and *putting the trimmed branches back on top of the bush, just sitting on top*. now we suspect he's spraying some chemical to kill the flowers and leaves (that he can reach) on the bush.
10. last but not least, he's constantly getting his hose and his sprinkler in our yard. he waters his plants from the top down?? and he was ""watering"" my mom's flowering shrub but was actually dousing my mom with a shower of hose water. my mom has a few painting projects and she has to make plastic tents in our backyard to keep him from ruining them. he's a dick about it too, i asked him to not get water over the fence because he was getting my plants (i have a container garden and i need to be careful not to overwater) and he said ""you're welcome"" in the smuggest, most vindictive tone.",UnethicalLifeProTips

4516, request - how to i disable the hot water heater when i am not home,"ately, my roommate has been a huge dickhead. he has done a multitude of things that have just added up and finally broke the camel's back. for context, i own my home and rent out a room to an almost 30 year old man. we have known each other for around 8 years. we have never really ever had beef until the last couple of months. we work opposite shifts so we are not ever in the house at the same time except for the weekends. at first he was an ideal roommate; he cleaned up after himself and kept to himself in his room for the most part. as of late, he has been lazy with cleaning up after cooking or using the shower. every. single. day. i come home and find crumbs on the kitchen counters, grease splatters on the stove range, crumbs on the floor, etc. he also uses my kitchenwares/utensils. i had a brand new never used non-stick skillet my friend gave to me for my birthday. i have never once used it and the other week i go to use it and it is absolutely disgusting. burn marks all over with char still in the pan and the bottom was so warped it looked like a wok. i had to ask him to replace it. he tried cleaning the pan before succumbing to the realization that it was beyond cleaning. my silicone spatula and silicone tongs are ruined because he uses them more than i do. i went to use the spatula and it literally snapped at the neck from him using it so much. i ended up gifting him the set of silicone utensils and procured my own metal ones. another instance was just the other day when i got a notification from my security camera that my amazon delivery was delivered. i watched my roommate inspect the package to see who it was addressed to and say ""why should i give a fuck? really."" (cameras have audio). later that day (while i was still at work) he walked over the package to go down the back deck stairs. when he returned to go inside the house, he again inspected the package to see who it was addressed to. i heard him say something along the lines of ""suck a dick"" and then a snide ""nope"" as he walked through the back door. i confronted him about it with facts from the video footage and audio footage and he straight lied to me saying it was unintentional. 

&amp;#x200b;

i have had it with his passive aggressive attitude and quite frankly, i am tired of the disrespect he is showing me in my house. 

so i am coming to the place i know i can get some good info on how to get back at him (in a sort of petty way). my idea was to shut the hot water heater off so that he has no access to hot water when i am not home. he is not on a rental agreement of any sort. he is living month to month with no contract of any sort.

&amp;#x200b;

tldr:
my student loan: 17k accruing interest

spouses (current grad student): 5k no interest until 6 months after graduation - can get 2x the amount needed for school in student loans.

so i live in the uk. i rent in the east anglia and my bf and i can’t afford to pay rent. he’s been put on furlough due to covid which means he gets a lot less. i’m a student and rely heavily on my mum’s help. she receives less now due to the pandemic. we aren’t rich. my bf’s parents are horrible to him and won’t help him out. 

reached out to the landlords asking them if they could let us leave our tenancy two months early. we really need to find a cheaper place to live as rent here is too high and they won’t lower it. 

they flat out told us they ‘sympathise’ but no. they’re rich fuckers, one of them is the director of a company but apparently they can’t afford not to have our rent; which i find difficult to believe. it’s £725 a month which i can’t imagine is a lot to them. 

there’s nothing in our contract that says we can leave before the contract ends at the end of july. just that it’s up to the landlord essentially. we have found some really nice, much cheaper houses we can move into and we really want to leave this cramped, claustrophobic flat. 

can anyone think of a way for us to either get out of our fixed term contract, or pay a smaller amount of rent? our landlords said if we can’t pay the rent we’ll have to pay it back. our parents are guarantors so i worry if we strike, the landlords will go after them. can’t exactly rely on their kindness, they’re dicks

4569, request: excuses for saying i can’t turn on my laptop’s webcam,"my university, at the beginning of the quarantine, said that the professors were not going to be able to demand that their students turn on the webcam.

now, they have changed the rules expressly and they are going to be able to ask us to turn it on (also the microphone), to verify our identity and to follow us during the exam.

i can say that i uninstalled the camera driver and therefore cannot turn it on?

maybe this is an excuse of innocence, as far as computer trickery is concerned, and the teacher will be able to break my trickery?
if the teacher knows about computers, will he be able to know what kind of computer i am using (its operating system) and if it is possible to disable the camera?

thank you very much in advance for your advice and own experience.

4570, eat free at any publix deli,"here a very smart yet illegal way to eat for free at any store like publix where they have a separate check-out and deli section and also has a website/app where you can order food for pickup. first you have to order food online to start it off and screenshot your order confirmation, then immediately cancel the order. go to the deli and order the same food,  then walk through the checkout section and out the exit. if anybody stops you asking if you payed, say you ordered online, this usually works flawlessly and your free to go enjoy the benefits of your free food. if they are still suspicious, show the employee the screenshot you took of the order confirmation that has the exact date and order of the meal you got. thank me later. also i don’t recommend stealing but if you’re really struggling the odds of you getting caught are very low unless the deli is right next to checkout or you are caught by one of the people at the deli.",UnethicalLifeProTips

4583,: screenshot an online exam question containing an image. photoshop a “broken image” icon where the image is supposed to be. email the instructor saying you had to take a wild guess because the image was broken and ask if you can redo it or have the points added back.,"his actually happened to me legitimately today on my exam on blackboard, but i realized it could be faked and wanted to share that idea. 

it was one of those questions like “referencing the image below, which letter represents where x would be the highest?” i had to randomly choose an answer because i had no idea what each letter was representing. i screenshotted it to email to the instructor afterward as proof on the 75% chance i’d get it wrong (i did). he gave me the options that were supposed to be there (turns out the picture was actually completely unnecessary) and said if i got it right he’d adjust my score.

i doubt every instructor would give that option.. thankfully there was a similar question with the same choices (not on an image), asking to identify “where y would be lowest.” i got that one right. x and y happen to be inversely proportional, so i think the instructor knew if i got one right, i should be able to get the other one right, too.

if you’re going to do this intentionally, be careful about making everything about the screenshot seem legit. on my mac, screenshots are time and date stamped to the second, for example (pretty sure that’s the default and can be changed to whatever format you want, but the point is don’t change the filename). the time and date stamp probably helped me because it would have corresponded to when i was actually on that question, which he could have checked into. iirc windows screenshots are saved as png, so don’t photoshop a screenshot just to save it as a jpeg. 

i know nothing about whatever metadata might be present behind the scenes of image files these days (screenshots specifically) and if so, how to prevent it from being changed by whatever editing program you use. i’m way out of touch with modern editing tools... so be careful with things like that too, if they exist.

anyway this went on for awhile. he forced me to be best friends with his girlfriend so she’d never find out, and i knew i had to get out when she asked me to be the maid of honour at their wedding (they aren’t engaged but whatever). i ended up writing a letter directed at him (but left so she’d be the one that found it) so that she’d know what was going on and leave him, because i genuinely felt sorry since she is a seriously good person.
his girlfriend stayed with him and let him convince her that i was crazy and just trying to come between their relationship. he’s never contacted me again.

this was almost two years ago now but i want to ruin his life. he ruined my perception of men and love and i’ve had so much therapy over this. i hate this. i hate this man. i hope he gets prostate cancer and dies. my point is that i need to get back at him, but obviously i can’t have him know it’s me.

and then began the part that i am most ashamed of.  roughly 1 year of whining and drunk texting her passages about how much i  care and love her, and she'd sometimes respond asking me to chill. we  almost stopped hanging out, and with time i realized what a jackass i  had been and the ""friendship"" became just me texting her every now and  then to stay in touch.  
now i feel i'm much different man who's  socially adept and has had a couple of real relationships. i am still in  touch, we barely talk. it's mostly me wishing her new years and  birthdays with random smalltalk which i know she's not interested in.

is  there a way where i can revive that old candid friendship by somehow  making her like me as a friend? i really miss the way we used to talk  and i feel soooo stupid over how i fucked it all up. i know it sounds  manipulative and impossible, but i just want a very old friend back. :/",UnethicalLifeProTips

also, how much was your highest refunds. 
i’m looking to find out the formula on each app to be able to play it safe. 
so far we have experimented with uber, skipthedishes and they both refund the money if you say that you never received the food. we have done on uber 3 times in a row and i think on 4th time it refused because the account was flagged and not to forget the important part 3 refunds each over 100$ around 120.

this is when i stepped in and pulled out my service animal card, disabled veteran id, and drivers license and told the employee that our animal is a service animal and he does not fall under those guidelines she was screaming about and therefore the service dog is allowed in the store. 

the employee got louder at us; so then i told mary lane that i was a disabled veteran with brain cancer and that’s why he is my service animal so then the employee turned to my partner and asked but do you have cancer, do you? 

this is when i broke down mentally, my service animal was in  the stroller starting to panic because he could not assist me during my panic attack because the empty was unwavering in her verbal assault against us and our service animal.

4775," request: how to ""accidentally"" break a laptop under accidental damage warranty"," **-tldr-**

i want to damage my dell xps 15 to the point it's unrepairable, while still abiding by dell's service contract. does anyone with fair knowledge of computer hardware know the best way to increase my chances of success?

**what’s covered:**

* liquid spilled on or in unit
* drops, falls, and other collisions
* electrical surge
* damaged or broken lcd due to a drop or fall

**what’s not covered:**

* damage due to fire
* intentional damage (such as hammer marks)
* normal wear
* cosmetic damage
* consumable parts (ex. bulbs, toner)
* theft (covered under accidental damage with theft service)

**-end of tldr-**

&amp;#x200b;

i bought an xps 15 9560 in 2018. i want to abuse the accidental damage support dell offers, however, i don't want to leave dell with the option of replacing certain parts and sending me back the same laptop. my goal is to leave my laptop in a condition that is unrepairable, while still abiding by their service contract. does anyone have any suggestions? should i go the spilled coffee route? or the dropped my laptop route? or something different? i understand that there is no 100% guaranteed way, i am more so looking for the way that would leave me with the highest chance of success.

&amp;#x200b;

i am looking to abuse the accidental damage support for the following reasons:

* my laptop is custom built with 32gb of ram, along with pretty much every other highest possible upgrade that is available, making it unlikely to be replaced with a refurbished laptop and instead be replaced with a newer model of my laptop. although the newer model would presumably have the same specs, it would still be nice to have a fresh laptop at no cost to me.
* for a very small period until they changed it back, dell placed the webcam at the bottom of the screen on dell xps 15's. i unfortunately bought an xps during this period. this is very, very, very annoying. on top of having an absolutely terrible view of my face, it points directly at the keyboard, leaving my face blocked by my hands if i am typing. its honestly useless and i have never actually called someone with it because of how bad it is. as they only sold laptops with this feature for a very small period, it is highly unlikely that i would receive a laptop with this same webcam placement if i were to get sent another laptop.
* the laptops microphone doesnt work properly and never has. it'd be nice to get this fixed without having to spend hours on the phone with dell while they try to troubleshoot my software, which isn't the problem.
* my trackpad has lifted up slightly over time for some reason, making it overly difficult to use. i could just call and get this fixed, however, i might as well just ""accidentally"" break my laptop and get it fixed in the process. or, better yet, get a new laptop that doesn't have this issue.
* there are some other minor complaints i have but i feel they aren't worth mentioning.

1. went up to their door when this first started and calmly told them i can hear all the things i mentioned above. i mentioned i'm not one to snitch and that i wanted to do the honorable thing and approach him before contacting security or management. he apologized profusely and gave me his number to text him whenever it happens. since then i've texted him numerous times, 70% of the time he apologizes and it stops. the other 30% he'll text me the next morning saying, ""sorry i didn't see this! my bad!""

2. two weekends ago the music was so fucking loud i could hear every word, every snare, every bass thud right from my bed. i contacted security and 20 minutes later it stopped.

3. last weekend it was so loud i wrote an anonymous complaint to property management.

that brings us to this weekend, last night was the loudest it's been. i'm at a point where i shouldn't need to text my neighbor everytime he decides to have a mini-ultra music festival at 3am. i feel as if he should have the respect to know by now, after the numerous texts and noise complaints that there's a noise threshold that once passed can be heard directly in my apartment. 


**conclusion and tl;dr**
i've done all the respectful ways of trying to get him to stop, now i need your help. i need unethical ways to get some revenge and hopefully get this fucker to stop (mostly revenge). i'm open to just about anything that **doesn't** require me to going upstairs to his floor in the building.

i'm looking for way i can effectively make noise from my apartment that will wake him up early in the morning, and that will distract him from whatever drug fueled isolation parties he's having in his room at night. 

**reference/ideas**

* i saw [this video](https://youtu.be/f3bvvsuah3u) , i'm wondering if there's any device i can buy that would do the same thing but to my ceiling?

* is there any device where i can have it on a timer that gets a hammer to release a strike on my roof every 30 seconds, something that's robotic and spring activated?

4809,: don't have a nintendo switch? just download and install a switch emulator and get the games as rom files online for free!," now, these emulators are typically used to dump your switch games on a pc and play them there, but you can also use them without having a switch or its games. you could use either yuzu or ryujinx for your emulator of choice.

there are a few downsides to this however. first of all, the emulators have been around for only 2 years now, so they're still in their infancy. so you may experience some technical issues especially in newer games such as botw, pokemon sword/shield, and acnh; but the developers at ryujinx and especially yuzu have done absolutely fantastic work on these games.

the emulators are free, though if you want to support these hard working teams, they have patreons where you can pay to get exclusive access for newer games and to support them. here are the links:

[https://www.patreon.com/ryujinx](https://www.patreon.com/ryujinx)

[https://www.patreon.com/yuzuteam](https://www.patreon.com/yuzuteam)

as for the games, you gotta get them in this link here: [https://www.ziperto.com/nintendo-switch-nsp-list/](https://www.ziperto.com/nintendo-switch-nsp-list/) but you also gotta go do your own research (watch youtube videos) on how to properly set up each and everyone of these games. another good idea to see how these games would function is this neat handy chart for literally all yuzu and ryujinx games [games - yuzu](https://yuzu-emu.org/game/) [https://github.com/ryujinx/ryujinx-games-list/issues](https://github.com/ryujinx/ryujinx-games-list/issues)",UnethicalLifeProTips

4811,"when playing league of legends, make fun of enemies to easily win","his could seem too obvious. but this game is purely mental. if you make fun of every time you kill an enemy or your team kills drake, or someone in the enemy team dies. they will play substatially worse. the games become much easier to win, not only for you, but for the rest of your team who will be playing against totally tilted enemies who play worse. these comments affect much more than you will initially think.

it is important that you mute all the enemies because you are not interested in what they want to say, you could end up being tilted yourself and playing worse if someone kills you and returns you the jokes or whatever. the objective here is being totally unhearted and just throw the stones without caring how enemies are going to react. you already know how most of them are going to react.

in this game people tend to be extremely toxic. it is very probable that if someone in the enemy team starts playing bad some other team mates start flaming them/threatening with going afk...etc

also it is important to mention that you do not flame, just make jokes, puns...etc so it is not bannable. also it is much more effective when you don't flame. some people have reached diamond this way",UnethicalLifeProTips

4870,: don't have a nintendo switch? just download and install a switch emulator and get the games as rom files online for free!," 

now, these emulators are typically used to dump your switch games on a pc and play them there, but you can also use them without having a switch or its games. you could use either yuzu or ryujinx for your emulator of choice.

there are a few downsides to this however. first of all, the emulators have been around for only 2 years now, so they're still in their infancy. so you may experience some technical issues especially in newer games such as botw, pokemon sword/shield, and acnh; but the developers at ryujinx and especially yuzu have done absolutely fantastic work on these games.

the emulators are free, though if you want to support these hard working teams, they have patreons where you can pay to get exclusive access for newer games and to support them. here are the links:

4919, request: get out of my college's mandatory bus pass,"my city has 2 universities and 1 college and they have made a deal with the bus service. for \~$220 a term, full-time students receive a 'upass' that allows them to use any bus/light rail in the city. since my city borders another province, the upass also works with their bus service.

i will be taking 3 back-to-back terms from september-august. i have my own car and live 15 minutes from campus. if i were to take the bus, i would have to take a 30 minute bus ride with 20 minutes of walking.

from what i've heard, it's incredibly hard to opt out. the college website lists these reasons for opting out:

1. ineligible students: essentially students who enroll as full-time and later drop down to part-time. this will not apply to me.
2. students who live outside of service areas: if they provide proof they live outside of the service area for buses. the documentation that they require as proof are recent utility bills and a driver's license. i live super close to 2 major bus stops, so this does not apply to me either.
3. other: students who have a medical exception. this was the route i was going to take, but i don't have any medical conditions, let alone one that would exempt me from taking the bus but still be allowed to drive.

essentially, if i don't opt-out of the upass, i will be paying approximately $650 for the pass and an additional $700-$1000 for parking. and of course tuition and books on top of that.

the upass is non-transferable. it will have my picture and name, the school's emblem and my student number. students that have been caught selling them in the past have received fines upwards of $1000. they will cite a bylaw that says you can't sell transit passes unless you're an authorized vendor with the city.

step one: locate the number for corporate headquarters. this is usually different than the customer service number and has a local area code.

step two: go on linkedin and see who may be a senior manager of customer relations, or in charge of the department causing you grief. he'll look up the cfo's name.

step three: call corporate, get switchboard operater and politely ask to be put thru to whoever you think can solve your problem.

***this may take a few attempts. linkedin isn't always accurate. also, you can't ask the op for information. do your homework. you need to give them the name or they will spam filter your ass quick.

my applecare does not cover adh (accidental damage) or spills. i was thinking of getting a usb killer to fry the motherboard but after reading more about the coverage, i've noticed power surge is not covered.

4948, : bored this quarantine? take advantage of the crippled argentinian currency and fill up that steam library.," 

i originally posted this into r/illegallifeprotips but i think this subreddit is more fitting. it wouldn't allow me to crosspost for some reason so i just copy-pasted the post below.

so, this past august the argentinian currency crashed hard. and it's still pretty bad. steam initially sent out a memo to developers to update their prices to account for the currency devaluation but most have either ignored the message or updated it at still a permanent, enormous discount.

all you need to do (what worked for me), is sign up with a decent vpn, expressvpn did the trick for me but i'm sure nord and whatnot work, and change your store location to argentina. that's it.

all games are at a permanent discount, due to lack of price updates, even steam's games themselves. half-life alyx, for example. 59.99usd in argentina? 650 pesos. or 9.93 usd. with no sale. easily beating g2a prices and other shady key markets.

when games go on sale, it gets really crazy. currently, dark souls 3 costs a converted measly 1.68usd. hell, cyberpunk 2077 can be preordered for 33$. nothing costs 60.

i myself have picked up around 500 dollars worth of games and dlc for less than 70$. dlc for existing games is ridiculously cheap, a megalodon shark card in gta v which usually costs 100$ costs 23$ in argentina. the community market has accounted for the currency however, leading to situations where you can literally buy games by selling trading cards. as i may or may not have done with countless dlcs.

edit: forgot to include - important. if you've succeeded with changing your store, you must use gift cards only!! unless you have an argentinian card. don't worry about getting ripped off on your gift card as steam uses up to date currency exchange when changing into argentinian pesos upon redeeming since all steam gift cards are worldwide. i find this ironic since they don't even bother updating the prices of their own games like half-life alyx.",UnethicalLifeProTips

4980,: get rid of your national post service and then establish full mail-in voting,"*note: any connections to real life or real people are merely coincidental.*

so, let's say you're the leader of a democratic country and an election is coming up soon. you're very unpopular and are worried about your reelection chances, but you know one thing, that if fewer people vote then you are more likely to get reelected. you also happen to be ruling during a disaster that makes people afraid to go out to a polling location. yes, it is already looking good for you, but you don't think its enough to really turn the tide.

you then hear over the news that a lot of people want voting by mail nationwide. but you know that would then allow more people to vote which will make it harder for you to be reelected. you think to yourself: ""man, wouldn't it be easy if we could just cancel the election and i wouldn't even have to worry about this?"" but you can't do that, this is too blatant and obvious. but you then realize you have a national postal service that relies heavily on your funding to continue operations cost-effectively meaning they can provide postage to people for cheap. then, you can realize something: people won't want to pay money just to cast a ballot, after all, there is a crisis and money is going to be tight.

you can then institute national mail-in voting which will make you look more like a preserver of democracy, and then you can say that closing in-person polls will make things safer for everyone. most people are going to agree and they'll decide to cast a mail-in ballot. however, this is where you get them: defund their postal service and then they will have to pay money just to vote and a lot of people simply will not that. now you look more like a preserver of democracy for bringing about a popular policy and you also get fewer people voting. enjoy your next term!",UnethicalLifeProTips

5002, request: is it worth it to lie to get out of a lease,"i moved into my apartment february 1st so i’m a little over 2 months into the year long lease. april 1st someone moved in above me and since then my life has been hell. i had a decent first two months although there were some issues with the place i got past them. but the floors are thin as hell and i hear every footstep they take upstairs. i’m very sensitive to noise and it really wrecks my ability to focus, sleep, etc. additionally, i’m working from home now and they seem to do nothing but pace around and move furniture 24/7. 

i feel like i’m losing my sanity with this and there’s nothing i can do. the amount i’m paying in rent is a fair price for a 1 bedroom but once you throw in the noise from upstairs it’s like having the worst roommate possible (for me). because of all this i want to move out. there’s no breaking of the lease clause mentioned in my lease so subleasing is probably my only option. but i’m not sure how likely it is my landlord will even let me (it’s mentioned it’s up to them if they’ll let you in the lease).

i’m worried if i flat out say “i’m moving because i don’t want to live here and need to sublease” they’ll say no. is it worth it to lie and say i got a job out of town, bought a house, my parents need me to move back in because they’re sick, etc. to increase the chances of them letting me sublease",UnethicalLifeProTips

i am in australia.

i have applied for a $30k personal loan to actually consolidate my partner's debt. my partner's loans are on 5% more interest rate than what rate i am getting. we will be saving around $135 a month on repayments and also a reduced loan term.

i am hesitant to provide this information to the bank as i think they may not give me the loan thinking it's not my personal use. it has been almost approved and this the last information they need from me.

also, i have never had any bills in my name, lease on my name, loans in my name, credit cards in my name, so i have no credit history. i am looking at this as an opportunity to start my credit file too which will i guess will help me in the future too.

so, what reasons can i tell them so that they will give me the loan?

here's a list what i have thought, (this will all be al lie)

1. overseas trip to home country (but coronavirus travel restrictions is a hurdle)
2. upgrade my car
3. renovate our kitchen/bathroom (but we are curently renting and don't own a property)
4. startup a lawn mowing business

~bootleg pins for your con lanyard? they got em.

~all those 14-30 dollar necklaces sold on facebook? sold for 5 bucks after shipping, or less!

~dice because you are secretly a dragon with a hoarding problem? absofuckinlutley.

it is a terrifying, and amazing place, but at what cost?

long shipping times, inconsistent products, bad products you can't return, expensive products, products that straight up probably shouldn't be touched by human hands period, but we love it.

how can you get the most out of wish for your specific niece without breaking the bank? well the answer is simple.

first, pick your nieche to fill, set an amount you want for your first 2 or 3 initial purchases. get a nice collection of things you want in your cart and order them. when the refund window opens, get as many refunded as possible, and buy again with your wish cash, whether it be same shit, different seller, ir more from the same seller, you gave given yourself a decent loop of sketchy products, that you can use for not sketchy purposes. you can't expect 1 for 1 turnout even if you buy from the same seller, but, for the amount you can get just by making 1 giant ass order, and utilizing wishes biggest issue against it. its a double win. most of wishes tracking numbers are bs anyway so unless you get one that works, you should be fine",UnethicalLifeProTips

5075,": i have been ordering takeout from the same restaurant for years and each time, i tell them they messed up my order. so they give me a free gift card toward next time.","actually, this hasn’t been unethical for me at all... but it could be.

my wife and i have been ordering from our  favorite corporate chain restaurant (don’t judge) about once per month for years. we’ve ordered from here probably close to 100 times. it is completely mind blowing, but they manage to mess up just about every order.

didn’t include salad dressing... forgot the chicken on the salad... gave us the vegetarian  version of a dish when we ordered the regular version. gave us the wrong soup. forgot a topping. completely wrong dish. gave our order to the wrong person and have to remake it while i wait for 20 minutes. i quite frankly would have to use my imagination to come close to guessing all of the various ways. 

it got to the point where we would wonder if we unknowingly pissed off a worker and maybe it was intentional. but this is a big place and i started to pay close attention to who was preparing our orders when i would pick up. it was quite often different workers. 

we briefly considered maybe it was our fault. not being explicit or clear enough? but the mistakes were always something different and we order online. so that didn’t really make sense.

anyway...

when this would happen, i would take 2 minutes to let them know on their contact form on their website. depending on the level of mistake, they would email us anywhere from a $5-25 gift card for our next order. 

since this happened so often, i started getting nervous that they would think we were full of shit, or hit some sort of limit that would raise a red flag for them. but oh well... it is what it is. then it dawned on me. they probably do think i’m full of shit, along with a lot of other people who do this. still, how can any of this be proved. so they keep paying up.

i was looking to increase my chances on an entrance exam where they have switched to proctoru because of the recent corona crisis (denmark). i was not even considering cheating as i have paid a substantial amount of money for private turoring specifically tailored to this kind of test, but then they went ahead and changed not only the delivery method of the test (online vs physical) but also the very nature of the questions (they are gonna be general logic/iq kind of questions instead of subject specific for the study this exam gives entrance to) which makes my financial investement wholly absolete and me, very pissed.

so long story short, i am pissed and i will try to cheat if possible. i have found the following setup:

i have talked to some tech-savy people and they all say that the logic checks out, as your computer does not detect a monitor being shared if it first goes through a vga splitter. but the article is from 2016 and i am wondering if you have any knowledge regarding proctoru as they are currently and if this would work out. i have a much smarter friend willing to hide under the desk of the desk next to the one where the computer is, and monitor my answers and if needed, relay the right answers back to me by tapping my legs/feet (we would have an agreed upon system)

thank you in advance,

5173, request [technical] looking for tips to defeat nude detection algorithms,"# 

i'm  not a programmer but from what i understand, these algorithms first try  and detect a face via eyes/nose. then upon detecting the face determine  the skin color and use that information to determine how many of the  pixels match that skin tone. if there are large unbroken swaths of that  skin tone, it's likely the image is a nude. then, there's breast/nipple  detection as well.

it seems if  people cover their face/eyes/nose, are hairy or heavily tattooed, use  black and white or sepia photos, or have a background that matches skin  tone... the nudes have a higher chance on making it through.

sooo... i'm need some advice. i'm trying to explain this without coming across as creepy or stalkery but it might not be possible...

there is this girl that i know. she doesn't know me, we've never interacted, met, etc... we went to the same high school and have about 10-20 mutual friends on facebook. we have both graduated college and are working now.

i started following her on insta about a year ago initially just because she was attractive. but the more posts and stories of hers i saw and the more i learned about her, the more stuff i saw us have in common in terms of personality, hobbies, etc...

its weird because i've never felt this way about someone i haven't actually met in real life. of course there are plenty of girls on social media that i follow that i'm attracted to physically but with her i feel like its something more i guess. i know this sounds weird and if it were reversed and i might find it a bit weird too but it is what it is.

she seems like someone i would really want to be friends with, date, etc... i want to get to know her in real life but not sure how. we are actually both in the same area and i know she goes to a certain hobby, idk if i should try to join and see if i can somehow end up in the same group as her (its bad i know but idk how else we would meet) or just add her on facebook and see if something happens? idk...

obviously if she ignores me or whatever i'll just let this go and move on but i don't want to give up so easily since its just so hard to find a good fit in this day and age.

got so much hate on relationship subs and figured this might be a better place to post this lol.

thoughts and advice are appreciated! thanks!

i know this because i regularly visit the house and the realtor padlocks are still on the property. 

i obviously am a college student in the united states.. i’ve looked into squatting laws but it seems complicated and my mom says it’s not worth it but hypothetically speaking..

is there any way i could potentially own the home? let’s say i change my drivers license address to that house and keep it like that for 5 years, and if 5 years down the line nobody still purchased the property, i can claim it? 

i hate to see such beautiful abandoned homes like this ...

i started doing this recently, and i purchased a solid walnut table for $40. i also purchased a box of jewelry for $20...

and i discovered three unheated royal blue sapphires. i found two oval cuts around 2.0 carats and 3.0 carats, respectively. and the third gem i found was a round-cut around 2.5-3.0 carats. 

and i picked up on a 2.2 carat black mozambique brilliant round cut diamond for $120. in the same box as the sapphires, i found about 30 ounces of silver, a vintage pierre cardin gold necklace, 3 mccoy vases, a 1980s vintage (genuine) cartier desk clock, and an unmarked steuben crystal bowl.  

so yes..... estate sales people. no one is buying because it’s a recession and tons of old people are going to start dying soon because of covid-19. these sales/auctions have tons of valuable items up for sale and no one to bid on them. i’ve seen people get imacs for $60, 64gb ipad for $100, and lots of other ridiculously valuable stuff for cheap prices.

5248,: how to fuck your mom during the quarantine,"
do you really want to fuck her or do you want to just talk about it. if you want to fuck her, and the quarantine, provides a golden opportunity for it, then here are the rules

**1\. alcohol must be involved.**

it will lower her inhibitions, but that's not why we're using it here. what you need is for her to give herself permission to do something that's beyond her normal mode of behavior.

get her drunk and comment how out of it she is and she'll never remember anything tomorrow. this will give her permission to be wild and not fear being judged for it.

do not drink much yourself or you might have performance issues.water down your drink, give her the full strength stuff. i say alcohol is a must but xtasy is better as it really drops inhibitions and makes them want to kiss n cuddle.

**2\. stress the unprecedented quarantine and how it's driving everyone crazy.**

as above this will also give her permission to do something unprecedented in her own life-- like fucking her son.

tell her how it's driving you crazy not to see a girl, etc.this will let her think of extra physical affection as keeping you sane: something a good mom would do.

however, do not be a whiny bitch. that will not make her want you inside her.

**3\. pull close then back away.**

let her enjoy your company then back off. make her miss your presence. give her a non-creepy kiss on the cheek and make her laugh with witty conversation. then go cold.

if she asks what's wrong just tell her the social isolation is annoying you. not in a whining way.

**4\. zero foreplay.**

the normal rules of escalation do not apply to motherfucking. once you manage to get her to french kiss you, pull her panties off and slip it in the hole you came out of.

normal escalation from kissing to petting to fingering to fucking will detract from the whole ""it just happened. thing she needs to allow this taboo to happen.

don't even take her bra off before you're inside her. penetrate then undress her.

**5\. assertiveness**

she is not going to take responsibility for this so you need to take the ""blame"".

the prone bone is ideal as you're the one doing the fucking-- in her mind. she's just lying there while you commit the incest.

if you do missionary, playfully pin her arms down and say things like ""gotcha"".

**6\. write the script for her**

the whole virus thing makes for a great way to write the story for her so that it must happen to deal with the stress and keep everyone sane.

other things are to ask her leading questions: ""have you every felt so close?"", ""do you like taking care of me?""

judo her objections
""this is wrong""--&gt;""this is love""
""we can't"" --&gt; ""we never would but we have to stay sane in quarantine""

do not use the ""i"" word . . she will never incest with you, but she will surrender her body to keep you sane.

they will let me in with the ""bare minimum of proof that i have a letter from a doctor, or a copy or a medical card from the states, or even a semi official looking letter with a stamp saying i either need marijuana for (my leg and/or anxiety) or a pic of a medical card""...

any ideas here? i have no access to pdf apps or services to even make an official looking letter. no microsoft editing products (on a mac, don't pay for any extra services, and i suck at computers).

5254,: how to take a screenshot of a snap without the other person knowing.,"note: this only works if you have another phone, or device capable of logging into snapchat.

whenever you take a screenshot of a conversation or photo on snapchat, the way the app tells the other person is essentially by sending them a message. the following method is basically how to avoid having snapchat send that message.

1.) once you recieve a snap you wanna screenshot, put your phone in airplane mode. (make sure the snap is fully loaded on your phone)

2.) take the screenshot of that nude you received or whatever. (at this point the conversation will say you took a screenshot, however that message is pending due the fact that your phone doesn't have internet access.) 

3.) get your burner phone or tablet, and sign into snapchat. by signing into your account in a different device it'll automatically log you out of the one you used to screenshot. (the burner phone will then load that snap you just took a screenshot of, since the servers don't know you've opened it already.)

4.) you can at this point turn off airplane mode. while trying to reconnect with the servers the app will realize that you signed in elsewhere and kick you out; and it won't send the message saying you screen capped the photo.

it can be a pain in the ass, but that's a small price to pay for salvation.",UnethicalLifeProTips

they will probably have a hard time responding to a lot of the time sensitive requests they have to meet when it comes to financial reporting laws. also with the coming recession, they may find it more likely to negotiate in terms more favorable to you, since they know money is about to start drying up real quick. if a lot of people do this all at once, which more people are likely to do being home now, it could overwhelm their capacity to provide proof of all the debts they are trying to collect on/become a costly endeavor for their company. 

also debt collectors are scumbags who constantly try to screw you over/fuck with your life, and the chances to return the favor can be few and far between.

you can file disputes by mail and through experian/credit karma websites, probably also transunion and equifax's. you also want to do physical mail (see the guides) here are some helpful links:

5284, reques,";dr at the bottom!

my mom's friend is newly separated (maybe a year) and has a bf. her bf's roommate (#1) tested positive for covid-19, but they didn't want it to mellow their vibe so they still went out. 

they went to a restaurant, and a worker tested positive shortly afterward-- probably not because of them, the worker (#2) tested positive like the next day or something, they were just exposed there too. at this point, the area was still open for business as usual and telling people to wash their hands and use social distancing. i \*believe\* they were also already saying to isolate/quarantine if you were feeling ill or had been exposed to someone who tested positive, but tbh i don't know although it's safe to say they had heard that advice. 

another woman (#3)  they were exposed to has recently been put into a forced coma. 

my mom's friend (i'm calling her covidmary) knew she was exposed and still came to my mom's house without telling her. my sister, who has asthma, came over while covidmary was there. covidmary's two good friends are immunocompromised and even on normal/ good days are very cautious. they are all at least 49, up to around 59/60. they have families, several members of which are also extremely immunocompromised.

now non-essentials are shut down in that area, but the covidcouple went to the bf's place --with the roommate (#1) still isolating there, i think-- to do laundry. covidmary claims she stayed outside while the bf did laundry, but i have a feeling it was to keep her friends off her back because they've all been telling her that she and her bf should have been isolating for the recommended two weeks since the roommate (#1) tested positive.

i think she is stuck in a second adolescence/midlife crisis and isn't thinking clearly. she is usually very methodical and cautious. but, like the fresh prince, her life got flip turned upside down and then this pandemic hit. i think she's acting like a teenager and not listening to her friends/family because they \*are\* her friends and family, if that makes sense.

here's my request... is it merely unethical or is it actually illegal (yes i know there's a sub for that too) for a stranger to call covidmary pretending to be someone from the cdc, saying they're checking up on those who have been exposed to make sure they are isolating, and to tell her that the covidcouple must stay inside in quarantine for two weeks because they have been exposed and very likely are spreading the virus, which may have already killed someone?

&amp;#x200b;

tl;dr my mom's friend has been officially exposed to covid-19 from a boyfriend's roommate, a restaurant worker, and a third person (i don't know the context) and they are not isolating. they've exposed many people, including at least 5 severely immunocompromised friends/family, while knowing they've been exposed and didn't say anything until afterward.

my employer has a convoluted bonus program rules, no undoubtedly due to tax reasons. instead of simply giving us a bonus, we need to submit an invoice (or few) for a personal purchase in the value of the bonus and then they transfer the full amount to my account.

this is stupid for many reasons obviously. what if i wanna buy something i'm not keen about sharing with my employer? in the past i've photoshopped existing invoices so i can use them multiple times, all they care is that the invoice date is after the bonus award date. but this is bound to eventually look suspect. so here's my request; is there an easy way to generate realistic looking fake invoices for well known retailers such as amazon, google, ebay etc?

the new stimulus bill provides $600/week in unemployment benefits, in addition to existing benefits which vary by state, but usually amount to roughly half of your previous wages.

for example, in illinois, if you make $52,000 a year, that's $1k a week. get laid off, you get $600 + $471 a week in unemployment benefits= $1071 a week.

now, you have to be clever. if you get fired for misconduct, you're not eligible for unemployment. so you can't just start screaming profanities to get fired.

instead, start talking to coworkers about your salary and ask theirs. start encouraging coworkers to form a union, in earshot of your boss.

it is illegal to fire a worker for those reasons, but it will make them try to find a way to lay you off, such as bad job performance(which doesn't kill eligibility for unemployment). if they try to dispute your claim, just threaten to sue them for violating right to unionize. they'll back off.

the real kicker is that he doesn’t believe in the corona virus and has said people are “fucking stupid for quarantining themselves. it’s just the flu”. i’m lucky enough to be able to still work and this fucker is putting my health and job on the line since i know he isn’t taking any precautions. we live in a studio apartment, so if he gets then i get it.

5393,for jerk employers making people work at non essential jobs for their benefit. there are wc benefits.,"it is very possible that employees who get sick from corv- could file and most likely obtain workers compensation benefits. 

wc benefits can pay up to appx 70% of a persons wages tax free while they are ill or injured plus all the medical bills.    each state has their own specific laws that very but in summary wc is paid for by employers to provide employees -- from work related illness, injury or death without having to sue.    
its a no fault system and protects employers from employees getting injured at work - meaning you forgive the right to sue for wc benefits.     its the ""exclusive remedy"" in most states meaning if you did try to sue - the employer would invoke the exclusive remedy argument and that's the end of the story in most cases -- unless there is fraud, or some type of egregious event.  ie  employer pushed you out a window.   

any employer who knows anything about insurance should be terrified of this risk.

and any employee who is required to be at work -- and gets ill from being at work has the right to file a claim for benefits.    benefits are determined by state laws and there are hearings to validate or fight cases.   many lawyers specialize in the area.     there will be arguments that ""the persons illness or injury arose in the normal course of employment""  -- so keep notes of what you did when not at work and any contact you had with others.

this worked, however it revealed deeper problems with the bearings and crank shaft essentially meaning that this engine is no good and we’d have to get a new one. 

it has already cost $3050 and the car still cannot be driven, 3 quotes later and the cheapest i can get the car back on the road was for $4700. 

$7750 is the cost of this car second hand.

so the only route i can see is to go through insurance.

5460, my lie escalated quite a bi,"what's up guys. i got myself into a bit of a jam.. smh.    
i had just started this new job on a friday,  and on saturday i wore a medical mask to work; because we sit within arms length of two other people and i definitely got trust issues because i think people are gross.  with everything going on i just wanted to play it safe. *i am aware about you shouldnt wear a mask unless you're sick yourself blah blah blah*    
somebody asked me if i was ok - and for some reason i said ""i went to the doctor this morning, and they told me they couldn't test me for the virus; but recommended i wear a mask for a preventative measure.*"" none of it was true.    

now i was noticeably snoozin' at my desk. so i get called into hr two hours after my shift started and they sent me home because 1. the mask was out of dress code 2. with the current situation they want to be  they tried to call me twice after i left and just left a message saying ""call me back"". so i didnt call him back, figurin we were off for the next two days, and i'll see him (today).

didnt wear a mask today, and i guess i still looked a little 'groggy' and 'sick'. fast forward to one hour before my shift ends, and they just tell me to clock out and go home; saying hr will contact me tonight. 

so he calls me and says it doesn't make sense that i said the doctor couldnt test me for the virus and i said that was because i didnt show any symptoms that warranted it. also i told him the doctor told me to wear the mask even though he told me to go about my business as usual. so he asked me to get a doctors note for him tomorrow, and cant return at work until it is verified that it's ok. so he required these things on the doctors note.

+ why the dr. would tell me to wear a mask if he told me to go about my business as usual.

+ confirmation if i can return to work.

+ whether or not i am contagious. 

they want it faced to them.

5470, if doing criminal activity (i.e. like selling drugs or just using phone texts in unethical ways that could be used against you) or just really love ur privacy. the police/fbi can not crack an iphone with a passcode without erasing all information,"here is of course apps that encrypt your data and stuff for this purpose as well, but still a fun fact thought i’d share via my personal experience with police taking my phone with warrants and then claiming they’ll get past the passcode and use my texts as evidence against me


i’ve had cops take my phone as evidence twice

why? because i was selling very very small amounts of weed to make a few extra bucks

so fun fact about police taking people’s phones and shit. if you have an iphone, and it’s an updated version (think it’s like ios 9 or later) and have a passcode, they absolutely 100% can not get into your phone to use evidence against you! (unless they know the passcode)

they’ll try to guess the passcode so many times that your phone will be locked for 3 months by the time you get it back! but they can’t get into it! 

first time they had my phone fire over a year, when i got it back i had to wait 90+ hours to attempt my passcode again!

second time they only had it for a couple weeks because their case was absolutely garbage as to taking it, and case got thrown out pretty much immediately (had me a good ass lawyer, their warrant was 100% made up on the fly, being overly dramatic to unawfully kick in my door and rip my parents house apart over 10 grams of weed. i was like 19 years old and stupid, don’t judge me lol)

both times they claimed “*well you can give us the passcode and we’ll get you your phone back to you on a couple days once we copy the information, but if you don’t give us the passcode, we have to send it to indianapolis pd and they’re backed up so it’ll take forever and you’ll never get your phone back, either way we can crack into it no problem*”

but i knew damn right and well that was an absolute lie, because it was all over the news at that point in time that the fbi couldn’t get into a serial killers iphone because apple’s failsafes (even if apple wanted to help, they cant without erasing all information on the phone when it’s unlocked)

so in conclusion, if doing criminal activities, or just want your goddamn privacy in general text messaging, use an iphone. cops will lie swearing up and down they can crack it, but they fucking can’t lol

and do not use the finger print scanner because they can pull it from their database and unlock your phone that way. make it a passcode no way related to you life (funny enough my passcode was 4 digits, and just my birthday lmao apparently they didn’t think to guess that though!)

if there’s one thing apple does way better than its competitors, it’s general privacy",UnethicalLifeProTips

i have no issues with the philosophy of it, but i am running into a pretty big issue that i am not sure how to get around. i would need non-nude and nude photos of a female so that i could send them to the person and use them for my profile pictures. i am not sure who’s photos to use because if the guy was to reverse-search the images he would see they’re fake. additionally, what if the guy asks me to do something weird (take a picture of you holding a fork is one i’ve seen guys ask to determine the legitimacy of the girl).

for my female redditors out there, would any of you be interested in partnering up with me to help me pull this off? all you would have to do is send me some photographs of yourself. i would then create online profiles with your persona. this way if a guy asked for a very specific picture i would just ask you for it and it wouldn’t be an issue.

payment would be split 80/20 between us and i would pay you in cash for all appropriate values. so, if a guy sent me a $100 amazon gift card i would pay you $20 **in cash** so you could buy whatever you wanted. that way we both can come out on top.

i do have a few requirements that should hopefully be easy to achieve

requirements:
1. must be over 18 years old (no minors)
2. must be younger than 25 years old (exceptions might be made if you look really young) 
2. must be blonde (blonde chicks typically get more donations.
3. must have large sized boobs (dd minimum)
4. must be shaven everywhere (no hair where the sun don’t shine)
5. must wear lots of makeup and be considered socially attractive (botox is a huge plus)
6. must be willing to send new pictures whenever asked (includes nude and non-nude photos)

you must be clean, dressed properly for the thing you want to do, and act with confidence like you belong. having a plan b is recommended, or at least good lungs if you have to run. 

age is important. you can't fake an inspector if you're 18 yo. nobody will believe you. you're 70 yo and you're trying to impersonate an audio technician? nope. 

if the event lasts more than one day, avoid the first day of gigs. air is tense, the production wants everything to run smooth and there are statistically more breachers, so security is pretty pissed of. the best day to try is the last day, when everybody is relaxed and the event is almost over. 

so, assuming you want to impersonate an audio technician: dress in black, wear short cargo during summers, wear gloves, a visible flashlight and multi tools on the belt. never wear a hat after sunset. never wear a backpack. water will be inside for free. helmets are used by riggers to build the stage several days before the show and days after it's all over. so don't bring a helmet. 

radio with biscuit is a must (the part of the radio police carry on their shoulder is a ""biscuit""). radioes are specific and do not use the open-to-the-public frequencies, so buy it accordingly. when you're approaching the gig make some radio test with the real technicians, and pick up a common name: ""hi, this is jim, where are you mark?"" if nobody says *who the fuck is jim*, you'll be jim for the night. never enter from the main gate. use a lateral emergency exit. go alone, never with your friends. walk straight, say ""hi whatsup"" to the security and you're in. they will not ask for your credentials. in the remote case they will ask your credentials, use your radio for confirmation. 

once you're in, be a gray man. this is not a joke. you must be invisible. keep a low profile during the whole event. don't get drunk, don't do drugs. don't do stupid things. you were lucky to enter for free, don't ruin everything. avoid the backstage of big events, security is strict and they will double check you.

never brag with friends. don't show yourself. do not post on fb/instagram what you've done. the pr of the event is checking instagram every minute, so don't be stupid. do not talk with anybody about what you've done. just enjoy the show and get the fuck out. since you're a technician now, don't try to ask the security to let enter your friends for free, it's not gonna work.

&amp;#x200b;

the next step is to forge a fake pass. it will be useful for the next days. you are a technician, so the mixer area is ok, you can enter. in medium events there are always more than one company that provide technicians involved, so you will always be a someone of *the other* company. try to figure the names of the companies. now get close to a real technician in the mixer area and take a picture of his pass. passes for the event are made by the same company that makes the advertising/posters, so the background theme will be the same 99% of the time. background, theme and colors will be available on the website of the event. logos of the event are generally inside the press kit pdf. use photoshop and don't forget to laminate your pass. don't forget to write your name and a number on the backside of your pass. try to copy a real pass as close as possible. print it at home, don't go to the local printer shop. close to the mixer area there is always a legend for area access. you would like a medium access pass. don't overdo, unlimited pass for all areas are few and security will double or triple check you. on the backstage of every stage there are refrigerators full of water bottles. technicians don't generally drink beer during work. never ask for free drinks where they sell drinks. technicians have coupons. bracelets are pretty much the same, just order some blanks online with various colors. passes have a strap, that is usually provide by the main sponsor of the event. most of the time is a beer brand. get one of that. attach your pass on your belt, technicians don't wear them around their neck. remember to go always alone. two technicians doing nothing and enjoying the show close to each other are very suspicious. consider also to get rid of your technician stuff once you're inside. 

if you can't get in for free the first day of an event, pay for a single day ticket and follow as above. or send a friend inside the event who can take pictures. wait for the pictures in your car, where you'll have a laptop, an inverter and a printer. you can make it if you really want.

if production realize your pass is fake, it's possible they will retire all the passes and make a new one with tighter rules. you will face a criminal charge and you will ruin the party for the other hundred of people like you that forged a fake pass.

be friendly with other real technicians, or people who serve food, or people who clean. be friendly and genuinely interested in anybody. ask why they love what they do. ask about themselves and write down their names. if you are planning to enter more events for free in your area, you'll realize the people is all the same, so having friends is always good. you can easily eat and drink for free in the next events just saying ""hey john how's your wife?"". 

be friendly with the security. even security will probably be the same in the future events in your area.  find a lateral emergency exit and chat with the big guy that's guarding the gate. he will be probably be bored since he's guarding a useless gate. bring him a soda. offer a cigarette. never offer alcohol. security are cool guys and they have the keys of the area. they can do unimaginable things if they want. but you're not doing this for immediate profit. remember his name and in the next event he will probably let you enter for free. the first year of the event you want to breach, you have to do solid public relations. this will grant your access for the future years. so trying immediate profit is not so good when you're doing this things. 

if you are able to reach the parking spot, take a picture of a pass on a car windshield. print in and use it. always carry on plain sight a transparent box full of cables in your car. if security stops you, say you work for x company and they need cables. security will check the plates the first day, but from day 2 they will only check your car pass on the windshield. try to go parking when there is less people. security is stressed when they have to check a lot of cars.

&amp;#x200b;

if the technician thing is not for you, there are always idiots that show on instagram/facebook their ticket days before the event. copy their barcode-serial number and print it. remember to be the first to enter the event because you can't use that barcode more than once. i don't think this will work for coachella, but a slight minor event for sure.

&amp;#x200b;

if you are not confident enough, ask for a free ticket to:

* sponsors of the show. sponsors give money to the production company in exchange of publicity. production gives back a lot of free tickets. 
* suppliers of the show (food, drinks, beer, tools, lights, portable potty wc and so on). they have tons of free ticket to give to their major customers.
* open a blog, post some fake entries with ""visible only to registered users"" as text. boom you are a journalist in less than 1 hour. production will never check your blog.
* the production itself. say you are mr.x from x organization. ask for a free ticket but specify why they should give it for free. most of the big production will never check who are you or your organization

if you have a friend in this field he can get a reserved ticket for you for free. the companies that work in this field are always the same and everybody knows everybody. it's common for a company to save tickets for their competitors, since they don't really hate each other.",UnethicalLifeProTips

buy a parking pass, register the pass with your vehicle.

your friend can park wherever they want with the pass. your friend will never get a ticket.

if you get a ticket, file an appeal with the school, most of these appeals can be done online in less than 5 minutes, submit your parking pass number, license plate, etc.

they will automatically accept the appeal because you have the pass, and face it, everyone knows campus parking enforcers don't care that much and can sometimes miss viewing it, maybe it was on the dash, on the mirror, etc.

if you have more than one friend with alternating schedules, you can throw them in on the deal as well to pass along the pass for even greater discount.",UnethicalLifeProTips

congratulations, you successfully legally and secretly infected all the poor people you met. they will suffer a lot from the virus, but they will die. they are least likely to go to a hospital, since some of them are usually not  smart and think its just a cold. they also don't have money or any means to go to a hospital or get themselves treated. also, since everyone is at their homes close quartering themselves, there's less likely that they will manage to infect your friends and family. you can choose a very far isolated poor community just to be safe.

(   we rent this apartment and he is the landlord of the building next   door).  on top of that my dogs lead the kind that screw into the ground   was screwed in where our fences meet. my patio is all concrete, i dont   have a yard, so theres nowhere else to put it. i did this without  asking  but its been there for about a year. i left to go grocery  shopping and  came back to my patio completely covered in all the leaves  from his  yard, and he unscrewed my dogs lead and either walked on to  my patio and  put it on my table or threw it.

what   can i do to get back at this asshole? i want to either get him fined   for not picking up his dog shit, or something worse. im not a fighter   and hes a bigger tough looking kinda guy, which is why i didnt confront   him. i'd like to get back at him passively, but severely. help!",UnethicalLifeProTips

use this site: [https://btc2pp.net](https://btc2pp.net?ref=8o7nppwz61f67gtx) (details bellow).



how is this possible? i asked them, here is the response.

&gt;""we use bitcoins to purchase items on dnm's (dark net markets), and we sell them on ebay for paypal. our paypal account are verified &amp; funds are legit. there will be no chargebacks.""

i assume they are buying cheap carded items.

***be carefull! i was part of their 'early bird' program and i have 8 transactions with them already with no problems or chargebacks. (1.2 btc sold)*** 

***but is always risk that they are using stolen pp accounts/some other ""funky business"", so i advise you to use burner paypal address (no id required, i had to submit my id when i reached 2k usd; use photoshop to create fake id; don't use us accounts).***


---

1) go to [btc2pp.net](https://btc2pp.net?ref=8o7nppwz61f67gtx) [refferal link]

2) create new transaction. you must sell more than 0.025 btc to get 32% extra rate. if you sell anything less, you will get only 12% extra rate.

3)deposit bitcoins. once transaction is confirmed, you will get 'enter bonus code' option on transaction page. enter code extrarate20 and you will get +20% on top of normal 12%.

4) wait for funds to arrive. it can take 12-48 hours for bigger amounts.

5) cashout (if you don't have bank account connected, buy gold with paypal (this site accepts paypal: https://mene.com) and sell it for cash).

6) profit!!!

i guess my question would be is how i would go about getting more empathy then not. the plan is to come clean - but i want this job, and my skills line up with the position. i get it - i shouldn’t have lied. my only justification is that i’ve been struggling with finding work for some time, even tho i have the “skills”, just not the piece of paper. the area i live in is also pretty dries up job wise. 

i’m not entirely sure either that i would have been called in for an interview without that on my resume. still, i nailed it and got offered the gig. i have to go in on tuesday to fill out pre employment paper work, education verification included. anyone got any ways to articulate my apology? do you suggest this in person or over the phone? i don’t feel like i should keep up this lie as it for sure can come back and bite me in the ass",UnethicalLifeProTips

\------------------------------------

1) drive to the store, leave the broken product in your car.

2) go into the store, buy the exact same product.

**\*\*\* 2b)** purchase the product at the **same** register where they do returns. if returns are done at a separate section, go there and ask a random question, tell them you want to buy the item too. if they ring you up, great. if not, they will remember you.

3) go to the car, swap out the broken product for the new one.  

4) go back in the store immediately to return the product.  my excuse: ""this was a gift for my brother.... i just called my mom saying i got the gift on her behalf... but she said she already got him a gift too, so i dont need it anymore!""

5) because you just purchased the product, they're likely not to check the box.... plus they will remember you as you just purchased the product 5 minutes ago. it helps if the ""broken"" product isnt visibly shattered or damaged.

5678, how to get free food from a fast food drive through,"his takes some timing and luck - but more likely than not you’ll have some success

- find desired drive thru you’d want to get free food from (mcdonald’s, taco bell, burger king, etc) 

- once at restaurant, make sure there is a car at the order window/screen and a car at the pay window in the drive thru. usually there is a gap between them. timing is key, as you want to make sure you get in between these cars somehow. you’ll look like a dick, but this step is necessary

- when in front of the order car (oc) and behind the pay car (pc) - you’ll end up at the pay window yourself

- tell the employee you “just need sauce” or “wondering if i can get a cup of water”. usually, they’ll have you go to the front, with the oc now at the pay window paying for their food. the original pc should be just about gone - with the oc food order being sent to the front

- you basically are mimicking the oc at this point. the food window has no idea you came into the line so they will probably assume you were next in line. with that said - and this part is a crap shoot - they will more than likely give you the food that was ordered by the oc, so you have to hope it’s something you want. 

- the oc will get pissed but most likely will have their food remade. now get the hell out of there and enjoy your big mac :)

5724, request: how do i stop my sister from always using the heated seats of my car.,"no matter how mild the temperature, my sister puts the heated seats on max and if i wouldnt allow her to do so, she would tell my dad who would tell me to let her.

she considers the car as ""not even mine"" since my parents paid about 90% of it, reason behind why i got a bigger car was safety for my siblings. i initially wanted a tiny opel adam or a vw up but now have a jeep renegade, which is nice but now my sister says i have to allow her to do what she wants because my parents paid for nearly the whole car.

i could theoretically argue, that the money i paid was the difference between a model with heated seats and without and therfore i should have control over the extra features but i dont know if thats all that strong of an argument.

reasons why i dont like her using it:

we mainly drive for below 15 minutes, the seats draw unnecessary power, dont even get warm until the last 5 minutes and i dont want the heating to be broken when its actually cold only because she used it all the time.",UnethicalLifeProTips

5787, request: how can i fuck with my upstair neighbor? (apartment),"dr at bottom. maybe too much info going into this. as i’m reading my own text this somehow makes me sound like an asshole. 

so here’s the thing. i’m living in an old apartment, i’ve been kiving here for four yeara, and apparently my neighbors thinks i’m too noisy. 
i’ve never heard anything from any of my neighbors apartments, but apparently they hear things from mine. i’m not noisy at all really. i sit alone all days playing videogames with headphones on when i’m not at work. 
some weekends i’ve had parties, sure, but i’ve always had my neighbors in my biggest interest and never made any excessive noise. i’ve gotten a couple complaints in form of notes from the neighbor below me and i’ve been really quiet since. 

the first time i got the complaint i had a girl over and we just had a fun time in the bedroom, ya know. the second time i had a couple of friends over and we took some lsd so we just sat in the sofa and watched tv the whole night. on low volume. otherwise just sitting completely still in my sofa. so this is the two times the neighbor below me has complained. i’m so confused because neither of those times i feel like i’ve made any noise at all actually. maybe the time i had the girl over, i can admit to that at least. and this all happened in the timespan of two weekends, so yeah, sure, i can understand if (somehow) it got to much for my below neighbor to handle to weeks in a row. 

so yeah. this got me to really back off and not doing anything at the weekends after 10pm because i really don’t want to get evicted. there’s a law here that says you can’t do any noise to the neighbours between 10pm-7am. 

now to the issue at hand. the neighbor above me is stomping on the floor for absolutely nothing and i’ve gotten sick of that behaviour. i mean i haven’t had a party since my below neighbor complained and i’ve never been loud at all. never had loud music, never yelled, never nothing. 

i’m raised in a house though so i’m not completely comfortable living in an apartment. but i mean you’ve got to have some understanding of your neighbors. i believe i have that understanding and that i don’t make too much noise at any time. 

these neighbors above me just recently moved here and today i was playing my guitar a bit and they started stomping. i play a acoustic guitar and just recently started, so i’m just fucking around with melodies like redemption song and whatever easy thing i can manage. so you know, it’s not any loud playing. just quietly plicking the redemption song to get my fingers to work. 

anyhow. they start stomping, and i’m getting tired of it so i’m taking my guitar to reach to the ceiling to stomp back at them. they stomp back, i stomp back and so forth. later they come to bang at my door and so i open and they tell me that if i don’t stop they’ll call the board of the apartment complex and get me evicted. i tell them i’m sorry and they leave. so now i can’t even play the guitar quietly at my own place because i’m scared of getting evicted. evicted of an apartment that i own by the way. 

what can i do to get back at the upstairs neighbors? i’ve been thinking of stuff like plucking some metal thing in to their locks or leave a can of paint right outside of their door. 

tldr; my upstairs neighbours are giving me a hassle and i want to get back at them without them knowing it’s me. what can i do",UnethicalLifeProTips

5850, request: hindering others from booking tickets,"one of my all time favorite films is going to be screened, but i want to be the only one there. 

so far i'm the only one who has reserved tickets. is there any way to stop others from buying seats, except buying all the other tickets (which would be like $300, not a lot of seats for this screening). 

seats are put on hold for 10 minutes during the reservation process, but is there any way to do this automatically? it's a week away and i think it'd be a fool's game to sit and do this manually every 10 minutes. 

sorry if this comes across as a bit weird, but seeing this film on the big screen itself is already a privilege, but seeing it alone would be a dream come true. i'm very passionate about it.

if, however, you can just take revenge or advantage of something or someone in an illegal or amoral way, but to no real benefit of you or anyone else, just don't do it. there's no reason to go around being evil for the sake of being evil at the risk of being caught and taken revenge on - just be illegal or amoral when it suits the situation.",UnethicalLifeProTips

5899,: [request] can i create a fake recruitment company and run my own ad campaign to get candidates to refer to my employer and collect referral bonuses," 

hello everyone,

i work in a new subsidiary of a very big pharma company in europe.

the subsidiary is in the scale-up phase and there's a lot of growth to be expected. that means up to 200+ people need to be staffed asap.

everytime a referred individual is hired, the employee who referred the new hire gets a substantial bonus in the next payslip

i've been referring people like crazy to take advantage of this because i think our hr and the staffing companies are not looking for candidates in the right places. (they are using oudated technology and they don't know the market they're operating in. plus, they don't get any referral bonus because they're doing this full time). having graduated in the city the company operates in i have quite a good network and i know the demographics, interests, and habits of potential candidates that would apply to this job in the blink of an eye if only they knew about this opportunity.

this is where my idea comes in. i have no idea if it would be legal and/or if it jeopardizes my job.

i'm thinking of making a fake staffing company profile on various social media, having a nice website with a cv submittal form and also a dedicated communication channel, run my own ad campaign with my own money as an investment and get recruits this way.

the ad campaign would be run like any other staffing/recruitment company:

no use of any of my company trademarks. in fact, i wouldn't even mention the name of my employer until it's time to refer. every referred individual will eventually mention my name on their application form which could be a risk if any of this goes against guidelines or it's illegal.

i would ask hr but i'm sure they'll tell me no because it wouldn't be the ""professional"" way to hire individuals.

i have already referred 8 people, the hiring manager tells me he appreciates my efforts but i'm afraid this would be too much.

do you guys have any advice? i could potentially buy a house by referring about a hundred individuals.",UnethicalLifeProTips

i was curious and used the feature to temporarily and instantly freeze my card. 

the airline tried to charge it later in the day... unsuccessfully.  i unfroze it when i needed it and froze again. 

never charged. 

tried several other times with ryanair, norwegian, easyjet, vueling... 

i have seen the crew connect their machine online after landing and were puzzled why all charges didn't go through. 

never paid for gin&amp;tonic since :p

5918, request: how do you defend yourself or cast doubt when there's video footage against yo,"so i've seen a lot of law and order episodes and sometimes lawyers manage to get video evidence against their defendant excluded because it's extremely speculative. how do they do this in laymen terms/explanation in real life? what questions/doubts are effective at being introduced when it seems that the odds are against you from a unbiased view? 

let's say a grainy security footage suggested you did shoplifting, cheated on a test with a tiny string of paper, or maybe trespassed or just caught you doing that tends to suggest that you did something you should not have been doing? anyways its a somewhat grainy footage that gives you a 60/40 chance against you, which might not be enough in a court case but is enough in a case where your judged by your peers/bosses that it's more likely that you did do it than you didn't

completely unnecessary and don't want to get off topic but one comparison the person i have to defend myself against did compared it to drugs. like how would you not know that drugs are in the back of your car trunk or in your apartment? it's more likely that you knew and your just blaming your roommate/friend/ or just an unlucky random act of chance when it was actually you. my defense is that i simply did not know it existed and the end result agrees in my favour. however, the camera footage casts doubts and that makes me culpable.",UnethicalLifeProTips

on the other hand, no one else except for the city (police) cannot issue parking tickets. if you get one, just throw them into the trash and you are all good. they cannot boot your car either, that would be a big no-no according to law.

beware, those does not apply to non-commercial areas. if you show up at someone's driveway they can tow you immediately. at some states, there is also an additional rule that a car can be towed no matter what after a set amount of time, make sure get the numbers right.

5984,: buy thing you only need briefly with the intent to return them.,"i've found myself in situations where i want a thing that will only serve me for a bit before it's no longer needed. the money i sink into the product is gone, and now i have a perfectly good thing in my home that isn't being used. luckily, a lot of stores hold very generous return policies.

my current example of this is a personal heater. my current rental home has poor insulation, so instead of paying to heat the whole home, i decided to pay for a personal heater. now that i'm moving out, i don't need it anymore. luckily, walmart will take it back. i cleaned  the heater up and returned it with my receipt within 90 days of my original purchase. the heater is absolutely in perfect condition, and just in case, the next owner will still have a warranty. i got my use out of the device while only temporary being out the cash it cost to buy it.

lowe's is similarly generous with their return policies. i needed a power drill for one quick task awhile back. mine was packed away for moving, so i went to lowe's and picked one up. i got my use, cleaned it up, and brought it back the next day.

i call this process ""renting,"" and it has saved me a lot of money.

i always follow guidelines to be safe and respectful. first, you assume some risk. if you break it, there's no returning it. ""renting"" particularly expensive things is really pushing your luck. you shouldn't ""rent"" things that truly depreciate in value on use like most clothes or bedding. i would be disgusted by if i found out that my sheets or pillow had been used. always treat your ""rented"" item with respect. someone else is going to use it after you do. just because you can get away with inconveniencing someone else with a shady return doesn't mean you should.",UnethicalLifeProTips

mind you i havent been to this gym in 2 yrs, so thats 24 months of payments with 0 attendance. 

also, when i first signed up i was offered a 'one time deal' on training sessions, but was assured if i slept on it and changed my mind, i could just remove them for a refund. so i went in the following day, and was informed that was not the case. i called management, then corporate, and the entire company was pretty much like, ""no one told you that, sorry"" ...so theres another $600 theyve been paid that went unused. 

i realize im partly to blame here, but im super fucken desperate.. even if i want, i just dont think this awful company deserved my money.

6018,": if you place a bet, place one that has a decent chance of winning.","most preferable is to not bet at all. but, if you happen to bet please, for the love of god, give yourself a fighting chance of winning at least something.

a 25000/1 bet is great and all, but there is profit to be made on a 10/1 bet. 10 $£€ at 10/1 will see a return of 100 $£€.
a small return, but a welcome one.

football accumulators: only pick teams that stand a chance of winning.
better still, choose a double chance option of either home win/draw; away win/draw; home win/awaywin.

the odds are less per match (perhaps 10/3 [decimal:1.33]) but, accumulated with a few others matches, it will give you a chance to win a bit of money.

instead of putting 1 $£€ on a 25000/1, try putting 10 or 20 $£€ on a 10/1 accumulator of double chance choices.

cashing out: as a rule of thumb, 50%+ of whatever you stand to gain is a decent return. 50 $£€ is still a decent return from 10 $£€.
sometimes, it is better to cash out if things look like they could not go your way.

if you do this, you could add a tidy sum to your income.

6064,: set up a tinder account to see if your partner's cheating.,"inone of this, ""oh, you'll just know... here are some signs..."" bullshit. some people are good at lying. 

i'm not above violating privacy to catch a cheater - usually on reddit, even if you catch someone cheating, you're still chastised for going through their phone or whatever. 

let's skip that part, acknowledge it's unethical, and talk about it.

i'll offer my first tip:

i caught my cheating boyfriend the following way:

- drive to coffee house across from his work

- set up a fake tinder account, i used some random asian girl's pics

- set distance to 1km (or as small as the app allows)

- set age to exactly their age, or +/- 2 years if you think they might lie about age

- swiped until i found him

- you can also use the exact same method on other dating apps.

i already had a big hint that he was cheating and this confirmed it. (whole separate story). 

hopefully someone sees this one day and does the same when they're unsure about their partner cheating.

if you guys have other tips on how to catch a cheater, let me know.",UnethicalLifeProTips

-find out what the minimum ammount of work is necessary to keep yourself not fired or expelled.how?well there's one way to find out god dammit , slack off until you get a warning , then do what you did previously , but work a bit more to get them off your back.

-limit human contact or cut it out completely , when co-workers/colleagues at college/school/university see that you don't give a single shit , they will stop talking to you too , works for higher authority figures as well , no one wants to talk to a cunt until it's 100% necessary , use it to your advantage , this can help you with being late because no one will give a shit about your presence + you can get away with working the least bit possible because people won't be on your back

-don't go for the promotion , the extra pay isn't worth the extra work

-aim to be one of the worst people working there or in your class , chances are most employers/teachers will put the harder work on the ""smarter"" students or harder working employees , pretty much taking more work off your back

-i know this goes against the don't give a shit about anything point i made , but , befriend nerds , you can profit so much off of them, for example ""hei , can you give me your portofolio so i have an idea on how to make mine?"" now the most common answer to this will be yes , then outright copy it , chances are it will work , risk it , you have nothing to lose.

if you get in a wreck, do the following:

when speaking to a claims adjuster or police officer, no matter what, you **always** braked, and you **always** swerved to avoid where applicable. there is no uncertainty; you did this. **do not** say ""they came out of nowhere!"" nowhere is not a place. nowhere is insurance code for ""i wasn't paying attention."" be consistent, and be aware the police statement does not necessarily hold sway with the claims adjusters; unless you were clocked, speed and similar things cannot be proven. witnesses may still sway this. 

insurance companies - particularly the adjusters working for them - **do. not. care.** about paying your claim or not; insurance is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the country (us). they care about paying what they're supposed to under your policy; no more, no less. as such, no matter how small the wreck: **you are always experiencing new back pain or other pain afterwards.** this will be doubly effective if you promptly go to urgent care or the like for it (regardless of any actual pain). this will increase your payout and only cost the insurance companies. or uninsured people, if you really want to be a dick.",UnethicalLifeProTips

most of the time, fish that die shortly after buying them are sick. and when they die, they release ammonia into the water, and when the pet store tests it they’ll blame their death on the ammonia. so, before you return the bodies to the store with your water sample, do a big water change so your parameters are good to go.

this will also work if ammonia is the reason the fish died. just be better about water changes next time.",UnethicalLifeProTips

6132,": young people, lie on your college application and resume","i gear this advice to the young person who isn't amazing at school but knows they can make things happen when they get to the place they want.

for teens gearing up for college, your college application should have all possible slots filled out with extra-curriculars. make them up, no college is digging through 10k applications and calling your school to ask if hakim was actually president of the fuckin' chess club. if you're applying to an ivy league that does some sort of background check then you're not the person this is geared towards as i'm sure you did all the necessary steps to get there. 

once you're in college, do decent, but much more importantly is some sort of internship or career related work. that's not unethical, however, the way you obtain it totally should be. your resume and likeability is absolutely everything. fuck your gpa, don't put it on your resume. if they ask for it, lie. unless you're going into some specialty like civil engineering where a lot of places will want an actual transcript directly from your school, there's a 90 percent chance they're going to ask you and leave it at that. 

did they ask you directly for the transcript? well, photoshop that bitch, find someone on fiverr, youtube some basic skills yourself, get it done. why do they ask you directly? going through your school requires them to get your written permission and they have to pay for it. most places don't want to go through that much effort on a potential employee and even if they want your transcript they'll be asking you to provide it. 

make up awards, volunteer experience, and miscellaneous skills. put those on there, even if they're irrelevant. you're in college, you don't really have relevant experience yet, they just want to see you're well-rounded. google volunteer organizations in your area, pay attention to your school emails for events and competitions, not to actually do them but to have a solid lie based on a little bit of reality. 

if you never really excelled at the modern education system (in the us at least) but you knew you weren't dumb, this is for you. the real world doesn't care about your schooling, that's just to get your foot in the door, you excelling at your job and backing up your bs with a decent work ethic will carry you the rest of the way through. the way i see it, the world is unfair as it is depending on who you are and what your upbringing was like, with a little bit of personability and bs, you can transcend beyond that.",UnethicalLifeProTips

so earlier today in school at lunchtime my friends and i were walking somewhere to play football. this bellend comes out of nowhere and boots the ball away

after this my friend asks him ‘why did you do that’ he tells him to fuck off loudly with teachers around but of course they don’t give a shit.

now for my age i’m tall but this guy is a year older than me so he has the height advantage by a few inches. i square up to him and ask ‘why did you say that’ and that bastard pushes me

now fuming, i tell him to push me again. but nooooo, he fuckin sucker punches me in the eye bruising it badly.

the teachers hold this prick back before i was about to swing at him and i’m not getting in shit for no reason. 

so here’s the situation now: i’ve done absolutely nothing wrong, i have not insulted nor sworn at this guy or provoked the cunt in any sort of way.

i missed my entire break time because i was in the nurses office as well and mostly spent my time writing an incident report.

when i get home a few hours later my friend tagged me on a post on a school meme page that read some shit like: rip u/throwthatshitaway he got clapped by ‘shotz’ as this knob goes by.

i need to get this prick back and i need to get him back hard. he would beat the fuck out of me so i can’t just go over to him and pummel him and i’m also not a psychopath and have somewhat of a future so i don’t want to stab him etc.

i don’t know where this guy lives and i only know his first name. but the fact that he only got a 2 day suspension for hitting someone who has done literally nothing and younger than him and when i know he has prior suspensions (2) for smoking he should be expelled. considering this is a school my parents fork out 5 fuckin figures for a year, i don’t want to walk around with the fear of getting punched in the face and the prick who did it getting away relatively scot free. imo he should be in juvy but give me a clap back that would make him wish he was rotting in hell. i’ll do something as long as it won’t get me expelled , but ima take a detention or suspension for this",UnethicalLifeProTips

based on this and other comments, it occurs very frequently.

a hidden cam will cost you about $50 online. one of these, a screw driver and an air vent, thermostat, lamp or whatever and you're golden; you could even just tape it under a desk.

should probably file down the serial number and buy a sd card with cash somewhere local to really sell the thing, just in case. but in all likelihood, they want to sweep the whole thing under the rug. it's probably \*actually\* happened before. the hotel staff may even be doing it in other rooms.

i need to stop this before i have to move my computer rig to my room and find an alternate location for my futon to prevent damage and smoke odor. what can i do to disrupt their activities and keep 12+ college students from showing up to party every other night? i'm not above calling the cops myself because we've already had a noise complaint from the neighbors and i'm not above psychological warfare. the only thing i need to avoid doing is getting the landlords involved because they're just two families running a handful of properties and one of our roommates are already getting evicted for skipping on three months of rent and evicting *this* roommate would put a financial damper on this property and i don't want to risk my rent going up.

**note\* in most places it's not illegal to use a fake resume. however if found out you can still be in some shit with your employer.**

**step 1)** pick the desired job. something you could pass for if you get it. something you can prove your “skill” in. something you meet all the requirements for. obviously, must pay well.

**step 2)** post a job listing for exactly what you’re looking for. make a few posts across multiple sites, copy and paste with slight edits an already existing listing with exactly what you want.

**step 2.5)** if too many applications, call hiring agencies and ask what filters they use to sort through applications and use the same.

**step 3)** find the best resume(s). copy and adjust it to your specific skills/background.

make 2 resumes. 1 for you, and a second which is an ideal, overqualified resume with a fake name, use different contact information for this resume.

**step 4)** apply everywhere with the overqualified resume. the goal of this is to get phone interviews, and video interview requests. if video, pretend your camera breaks. if phone, change your voice. the goal of this is to gather a list of every question you’ll get asked, so when applying with your actual resume you can have answers ready and nail the first impression every time.

**step 5)** prepare for interviews. do research on most likely asked questions. make a list of every question and have answers ready. decide a list of values for the impression you want to give off. things like: efficient, has lots of options, conscientious. design your answers around these values. this is where sales skills come in. things like social proof, high value, fear of missing out. all of these and a few more is what you’re going for.

also, create proof of experience that you don’t really have. make a few fake screenshots and claim responsibility for work others did. if you encounter a question you don’t have proof for, ignore it and guide the conversation back to what you have ready.

**step 6)** apply everywhere. don’t bother reading job listings, just apply. copy n paste answers. use ai bots to fill out applications for you. do this as quickly as possible.

**step 7)** the interviews. try not to fuck up.. but you inevitably will. each time you make a mistake or don’t know something, plan for the scenario to happen again and be ready. oh, and don’t forget, you shouldn’t expect to get a job anywhere. if you assume you’re going to fail, then that takes a lot of pressure off. just have fun with it. experiment with thing nobody else would.

so apple has a 14 day return policy on any phone and a 1 year factory warranty and iphones. so what you do is buy the phone you want (you’ll have to pay it all up front bc they only lease it to you thru a phone contract and you don’t want that) and then go online to offer up, let go, any local thing like that and buy the same phone but with either an icloud lock or something wrong with it where it is significantly cheaper than new. once you have that phone you need to short the electronics so that the device won’t turn on ( very important to not submerge it in water) if they open the phone and see water damage you are not covered. but once you have the phone at the apple store you tell them it’s the one you just bought (5 days ago, 20 days ago, 45days ago etc..) and it just stop working one morning when you tried to power it on and it won’t charge. they person helping you will try to get the phone to turn on to get the information from it but as long as the phone can’t be powered up they can’t get the imei information to verify it’s the phone you say it is, therefore it is there own policy that the phone is considered to be under warranty and defective and they will replace it free of charge. now walk out of the apple store with two brand new iphones and sell the one that you originally bought from them (incase they see that the imei or other traceable information from that phone is still being used and they try to turn the phone off or lock it) you will be long gone with your new working phone that you got for a broken price",UnethicalLifeProTips

6328, just lie on your resume if you have gaps by saying you “tried” to start a small business.,"face it. it’s ridiculous, but most employers hate gaps in a resume. it doesn’t matter what your excuse is. you may not even get a call back if the website’s algorithm notices a gap no matter how qualified you are. 

just put on your resume that you started a business during those gaps. everyone loves a wantraprenuer. think about something you’re interested in. something that you have a lot of knowledge about, even if it’s just a new hobby. tell the story like *i’ve always wanted to do it so i took the plunge, blah blah blah...*  

admitting your “failures” are a big part of lots of interviews too. cite why you quit your adventure by using the [sunk cost fallacy])”(https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/sunk-cost-fallacy/ ) to justify your failure(s).  then make up an exciting quitting story like: *i started a mountain biking tour company until i broke one of my ribs and i couldn’t run it anymore*.  i do mountain bike and i did break a rib in a big crash but i give zero fucks about starting a mountain bike touring company.  i could easily sell it though because it’s mostly real life experience that i can draw from and i’d just talk about how horrible it was just to breathe because that’s definitely not a lie. 

absolutely no one will question you in a formal situation if you can talk the talk.  are you a dnd fan? do you love gardening? do you make shitty go pro videos that get maybe 12 views on youtube? perhaps you’re an instathot. it doesn’t matter. create any kind of “small business” and throw it on your cv. there’s literally no way a potential employer will try to prove whether or not you “tried” to start a business during your gap if you talk the talk. plus it’s looks really good that you “tried” because most people never even try to start their own business. for lots of people it’s some kind of mythical, fascinating thing.

you’ll also steer the conversation towards something you love to talk about instead of answering stupid interview questions.

my question is, how is this situation possible, that no collection agency or larger company is pursuing the debt from that sale? and does anyone else have a story or advice (educational purposes only, of course) on how to buy a car, make a payment or two, and still get the title legally transferred to your name",UnethicalLifeProTips

pros:

possibly easy money, my car is almost 6 years old with your average use, bumps bruises scrapes, so minor damage isn't a problem for me.

here are additional few things that i observed so far, if you open a new account, using completely new address, new payment method, or even new ip address. then everything under $100+(may up to $200) should be fine, still depends on luck, but there's highly chance success anyways. next, if you want more trust they gain from you is placing few orders, doesn't matter how much those worth, make it as legal account and then do dna for a big order(up to $500+, never try $1k items). then you better stop after done a big order, or purchase few small piece items, make them feel you actually lost the package, you are still a valuable customer. i also wouldn't recommend doing dna on those cheap items,  claiming dna on $20-40 item literally same as $100+ items.(as i said, the tip is how often you do this, claiming dna for 4 items that total worth about $100 is much worse than claiming one item that's already worth $100) the last thing is when the chat agent transfer to you some specialist team, this is a very bad sign, but it doesn't mean the higher level agent would deny to refund you, but your account is definitely flagged by them, which means they are checking your purchased histories, your address, and your credit card information, and decided whether to refund you.

hiring people to follow someone around isn't illegal, and there even exists an industry for it. just make sure that whoever you're hiring doesn't know who you are, in order that the people you hire don't inadvertently tell the person you're having followed knows it was you. the person being followed won't know who or why they're being followed, and while they might be able to guess your involvement, they might mistake the origin for someone or something else in their life that they believe is more likely to perpetrate that kind of low grade torture, such as the government or a shadowy corporate conspiracy. the victim will experience fear and distress, as they won't know how far any such individual or group having them followed intends to go in possibly harming them, and you will never need to actually break any laws or use physical violence. in fact, you should avoid breaking any laws or using violence, as both can provide evidence for the victim to support their case of a group acting to harm them.

having someone followed is not only legal, it is also probably the most harmful torture you can inflict on someone in which you are virtually certain to get away with it.",UnethicalLifeProTips

6400,": want to become the world's first trillionaire? all you have to do is learn the magic of robbery and holding people for ransom, spreading fascist propaganda around the world, developing an ai to make you live forever, and starting a global fascist war-like zone where you and your spies benefit."," everybody wants to become the world’s first trillionaire. most people advise that you would need to start a tech company or be able to mine an asteroid to become one. but low and behold, the world of politics.

so, to start this off you will need some money. you can ask your parents or rob homeless people’s money jars. you just need enough money to be able to buy robbers gear and to have as much money as possible left afterwards: mask, black shirt, knife, gun, human-sized bag, etc.. now, you will need to go to a shady community near your area and go to the nearest alleyway. 

there will probably be some druggies, but with your leftover money, instead of buying drugs, you can simply give them money if you train them to be sneaky and get away from police(since they probably know a lot about that). 

after you have been trained well, you will now have to go back to your normal community. you will now target rich/middle class houses. with your tips from the druggies, you can go in at the right time and either steal their child or steal a valuable good(if they have one).

if you steal their child, you will have to leave a chip somewhat hidden in the home with an audio recording saying that you will need to pay them a certain amount of money to get their child back, and give your bank information for the transaction. after that, you can return their child in an agreed location(in the chip) and continue on.

if you steal their goods, you can just sell them easily in the black market. remember to always move around in different locations, because soon enough you will be on the wanted list(and it will only get higher from there!).

once you have collected enough money, you will now start an underground business(like a drug business). here, you will make food and hire people to give the food to the homeless, along with a location where they can buy to get more(which will be a base camp of your company). but, you will put a secret drug of your choice in the food so they continuously come back, always scraping enough money to buy more.

with this new company, you will now hire more people and spread this all around the world. but your primary target will be poor african nations. because after a little while, instead of giving the african homeless food, you will give them propaganda news. this news will fake the news and encourage them in the ways of fascim: their race is better and should oppress other races, the current government is incompetant, and the rich are ruining the lives of the poor.

since they have no other news source, word will spread and more people will start to believe it. eventually, many people will create underground rebel groups. with your well trained spies(since you have a lot of money so you trained them well), you will send them to these groups.

eventually, they will rebel against the current government. with most of the population with them, they will be able to win. due to the propaganda that you sent these people, they will begin to fight each other over which race is better. but they will be so busy with fighting that they won’t notice that your spies will actually be harvesting the resources and collecting slaves(of the other races) and sending them(along with money) over to the company bases.

here, you will be able to use the enormous amount of money and slaves to begin to expand your “company empire”. you will send spies all over all countries of the world and begin to secretly release propaganda to the people(if you have even more money and slaves, you can develop a device that hypnotizes people into believing the propaganda). they will also collect more money and slaves. 

also, i forgot to mention your lifestyle. you will have a beautiful house(armed with technological weapons) where you have slaves and money to do whatever you please. a lot of the money will also go to you, so you will become the world’s first trillionaire. also make sure to pay your top spies well. 

anyways, the spies will spread fascism to the people until they eventually rebel. when they do, the current governments will have almost no power and will lose quickly. now, everyone in the world will be constantly fighting each other, while you and your top spies will be sent loads of money and protected houses. 

during this time, it will also be best to begin developing an ai that can control every single person and make them do whatever you want, so no one will rebel against your beautiful regime. this ai will also be focused on making a device that could make you and your top spies live forever/never die, so you can live the lavish lifestyle forever. 

you have now become the world’s first trillionaire and have achieved the dreams of every person. living in a paradise where everything comes to you when you want it to. you can do everything you dream of doing, any time, forever. 

but was it worth the cost? was it worth the millions, or billions of people that brutally lost their lives for you? was it worth losing touch with reality and becoming the most evil person that had ever lived? was it worth barely being able to sleep at night with the weight of the blood you purposefully shed? that’s for you to decide, **future trillionaire.**",UnethicalLifeProTips

6448, - real life money glitch!,"ok  so basically i found a glitch on a website that i recently became a  member of.  this glitch allows members to use $10 coupons that stack  (i.e. x2 coupons = $20.00) an unlimited amount of times. only limit to  this is that transactions have to be done within 30 minutes of placing  the order.

here is how it works,

i  signed up for a credit account and got approved for $1000.00. they  offer 1 point for every 1 dollar spent, after you get 200 points you get  a 10 dollar coupon. 2000 maximum points can be earned per transaction.

i  then spent $800.00 on 1 item in store and got (4) $10 off coupons. this  item is still able to be returned after redeeming the points.

a  few days passed and i saw a nice deal online and i signed into my  account, and used the coupons to get $50 worth of items for $10.00.

i  placed order and continued browsing, saw something i wanted, went to the check price in cart, and it said my coupons were still there. so i went  ahead and made another $50 order for just a $10 dollar bill. checked  both orders and they were both confirmed as being placed.

so  at this point about 25 minutes have passed before i realized this, so i  placed 2 more orders and when trying to place the third it was not  showing up anymore. i realized this was due to the 30 minute  ""cancellation period"" was over, cementing my first order in place. so in 30 minutes, i placed 5 orders, spent 50 dollars and got 250 dollars worth of stuff.

i  waited a few days and called the company, they confirmed two things for  me. the first was that all the orders i had placed actually went  through. the second was that nothing showed up on their end that threw  up any red flags as far as a customer getting $250 worth of goods for  $50.

i tried it again with a 10.00  off voucher that came in the mail and it worked the same way.  so the  ideal setup would be to have the coupons for points as they don't need  to be manually typed in every time you make the purchase.

ok now, you may have read that and said to yourself, wow, this is very vague.

the  reason it is vague is because if i said what it was, people with deeper  pockets would have the ability to get $5000.00 items sent to their  house for free, (just pay shipping) lol. and that would only result in  this loophole getting blasted shut. hint: its a major retailer, has an online website, and can buy very expensive items!

my  main reason for posting is because this site does sell a lot of high  end items, so my goal would be to get $1500.00 or more in reward  credits, and use those to buy a $1500.00 item, over and over again for  30 minutes, get 20-30 orders in and get that cool 20-30k worth of items  delivered to my doorstep with a receipt to prove the purchase!

can  anyone help recommend the best way to get this money! i am broke so  earning points is rough. need to spend 15k on items to get the points,  these items are returnable, as points are applied and coupons earned  automatically. but points get limited to 2k points per transaction. so would need 8 separate transactions of \~1900.00, then you could literally pull a diamond heist.",UnethicalLifeProTips

6455,: keep an old pair of crutches and a leg brace around so when you order delivery you can pretend to be crippled...,"....and put in the delivery notes that you're crippled (or injured, on crutches, etc.), your apartment building doesn't have an elevator, and you can't climb the stairs.

this will force the delivery driver to find parking and bring the order to your door without expecting a huge tip or copping a bad attitude for being asked to make an extra effort. it's a win-win - they feel good because they did something nice for a disabled person, and you don't have to walk down the stairs and climb back up to get your food/weed/whatever you're ordering. 

this tip is obviously restricted to people in apartment buildings without elevators. i live in los angeles, and it is common here for the older apartment buildings to be two or three stories and not have an elevator. however, if you tried, you could definitely stretch this narrative a bit to account for apartment buildings with an elevator or even a home (although i find people who live in actual homes in the suburbs rarely have this problem with delivery drivers because they have an easy time parking). 

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

and to elaborate on my ""justification"" for this tip:

&amp;#x200b;

i realize that any non-disabled person has the right to ask a delivery person to come right to their door; however, in la, i've found that delivery drivers tend to cop an attitude when you ask them to park and walk to you, especially if it involves climbing stairs. i understand why it's a pain in the ass to park and walk - it takes a lot more time and with postmates/ubereats/doordash/etc. the drivers have a huge incentive to do as many orders as possible as little time as possible (according to friends who have driven for some of the apps they do this because most people don't tip well/at all). 

and i get that that's the driver's problem; however, having known quite a few people who have done postmates/grubhub/ubereats/etc, if you piss them off or inconvenience them enough, i have heard firsthand stories from former/current drivers of them taking a few fries from difficult customers' food, etc.. i've never heard of anything serious like a driver putting something in the food; however, i wouldn't put it past someone to do. 

i'm a huge germaphobe, and i feel violated knowing someone may have had their hands in my food/contaminated it in some way. idk if anyone else feels the same, but i feel like this is an innovative and harmless solution to get the delivery driver to make the extra effort while effectively eliminating the chance of them getting pissed and/or possibly messing with/picking at your food. 

and most people will go out of their way to be a little kinder/accommodating to handicapped people. and a lot of the delivery apps have a rating system that applies to customers and drivers. i'm obligated to say that i have never driven for a delivery service; however, again, i've heard firsthand accounts of drivers giving customers poor ratings for making difficult/unconventional requests. 

especially with ubereats, postmates, etc. and other delivery apps taking over the food delivery space, drivers can always claim the restaurant made a mistake or someone there messed with your food. it's different than when a delivery driver who is an employee of that restaurant messes with your food and gets accused after bringing it to you themselves. restaurant employees are likely to see consequences, while the postmates/ubereats/etc. drivers are not. if pressed and the customer and/or company and/or restaurant are making a big deal about the order not being right or being tampered with, the driver can always claim they just forgot to check the order before leaving the restaurant. they may end up not making any money on that order; however, if pressed/accused, they wouldn't see any real consequences (unless it happens often). and again all this information comes directly from multiple friends who have driven for these apps in the past.

not to justify this behavior as a customer; however, i see this as an equally and opposite unethical response to protect against the strong likelihood of  you, the customer being on the receiving end of unethical behavior that's often overlooked because people tend to empathize with a service industry worker more than a customer who is being lazy and demanding.",UnethicalLifeProTips

***it’s called “the five dollar auction.”***

***you stand up in front of the group, and hold up a five dollar bill.***

***you explain that you will auction this five dollar bill off, and the highest bidder gets it, even if the high bid only a dime. bidding starts at 10 cents, and goes up in increments of 10 cents or more. there’s just one trick to this auction, and that is that when the auction ends, whoever has the second highest bid also has to pay, but doesn’t get anything.*** 

*heads nod, and you ask if anyone will bid a dime for the five dollar bill?*

*bidding also proceeds quickly at first, and once the bids are at $2.60 and $2.50, you are guaranteed a profit.*

*bidding continues quickly until the high bid gets to about $4.90. at that point the second highest bidder realizes that they will lose $4.80, unless they bid $5 and break even, so invariably they bid $5. there’s usually a brief pause at this point, but then the other bidder (there’s always only two bidders at this point) realizes that they will lose $4.90 unless they bid $5.10, so better to lose 10 cents than $4.90.*

*once bids are over $5, the value of the item is forgotten, and it becomes a battle between the two remaining bidders, each of them alternately deciding it is better to bid higher and at least end up with the $5 bill.*

6719,: using desperate people for money,"as a previous askreddit thread brought to my attention, there's a lot of people so desperate for love in this world they're willing to pay extortionate amounts of money if they feel they're being loved. it's not even too difficult to get them to this point, all you have to do is consider it an investment. now it may be quite a long term investment as you'll likely have to speak to them for several months for an hour or two most nights at least before they're willing to send any significant sums in your direction. however if you can manage to talk to several lonely souls at a time this becomes quite lucrative. 

now it gets better, as these people aren't exactly few and far between, especially because you find massive communities right here on reddit. r/foreveralonedating for example. if you visit the sub you'll even see that the moment a woman posts she's flooded with attention from lonely guys, often with decent jobs and decent lifes that could afford to pay for her lifestyle. obviously it comes with saying to play smart if you follow up with this and i in no way condone this act but making a good fake profile and using cropped photos that can't be reverse image searched can go a long way and make you a lot of money if you do it well but the real difficulty will also be making sure you don't mess up with the money because you don't want your bank account being shut for fraud.

this only really works if you have some free time and aren’t around other people but i’ve been using it for years now. lendingtree is just the most recent asshole to decide to send spam calls. over the years my spam call volume has dropped from 5x a day to maybe 2x a month. try it. it works.",UnethicalLifeProTips
6726, getting out of directv and uverse contracts :),"hey there! i've known this trick for a while, and while i don't need it anymore, i thought i should share to hopefully help out someone else!

at&amp;t and directv will let you out of their tv/internet service contracts if you're moving and the service is not available at your new address.

all you have to do is call customer service, let them know you're moving, give them the new address, they'll run it thru, and when they realize it's not available, you just act disappointed until they let you know they're going to cancel your contract.

uverse internet and tv is pretty easy because there's lots of places they don't service for those products, directv is a lot harder b/c they are willing to smack a satellite pretty much anywhere lol but it's still doable if their system does not recognize your address.

in order to find an address that's not available for any of their products, i started w/ a map of broadband coverage at [https://geoisp.com/us/](https://geoisp.com/us/) \- found an area in texas where there's absolutely nothing, middle of nowhere, flower mound tx. pulled up [realtor.com](https://realtor.com/) searched up flower mound, filtered search to land for sale. found an address that looked pretty simple, but with photos that looked like it was definitely just a lot of dirt and nothing else. you can check uverse availability on the website [https://www.att.com/availability/](https://www.att.com/availability/). it will always say you can get directv though, so w/ that you just have to wing it. i used to know someone who worked for at&amp;t so they were able to check my address thru the system before i made my call, so you could do that if you're able. otherwise, just try it. call them up, if they ask questions, you can say its a new house you just built, whatever they say just try to be really friendly, a bit vague, and pretend you genuinely want your products moved (ie; don't sound like you're trying to cancel lol). when they realize services are not available, i usually just pause, sound really bummed and say something like ""damn okay, what do we do now?"" don't mention the contract, they will deal w/ that when they begin the cancellation. if you run into any roadblocks, or feel like you're getting the wrong results, don't hesitate to hang up, or say ""shit sorry i have another call coming through i'll have to call back later"" etc. most of the time, i was able to get the job done on the first call but occasionally i had to try back and get a better rep.

hopefully this helps! let me know if you have any questions and i will try to answer :)",UnethicalLifeProTips

she’s not talking to her friends, and she feels “disconnected” from school, her part time job, and even from us (according to our convo two days ago).  

her bf: 21, one misdemeanor for drunk in public / drinking underage, works full time while going to school. he drinks heavily, and he’s started saying cruel comments to her once he’s drunk, then he passes out. he also pressures her into taking care of the house. when he’s not drunk, he sends her belittling articles and gets passive aggressive with her until he gets what he wants. 

the dilemma: she’s going back and forth about leaving him, and after our convo, he promised her he would stop drinking. i remember when i was her age, i absolutely would not listen to anyone who told me to leave an asshole bf. i don’t want to call the police / i know from experience it’s not at that level yet. i have their location, i can find out where he works easily. i do not live in their city but i can get there semi regularly. i will not do anything illegal, i’m here for shiesty suggestions.

6775,: how can i completely fuck over my neighbor,"how can i completely fuck over my neighbor

looking for some advice on how to deal with my piece of shit neighbor.  i’ll try to get as much detail as possible. 

i live in a rural area on my grandparents property with basically only 2 neighbors in sight. one across the river and one about 30 yards away. my issue is with the one closest to me. the owner of the house isn’t so bad, keeps to himself and is quiet. but this idiot has a twin brother (mid 50’s) and is a real piece of work. 

i personally suspect he’s snooping around my property and night and when we’re not home but nothing has shown such. he’s shot at my chickens, and shot near my grandpa whilst shooting chickens. (while they were on our property) 

he honks every time he drives by my house? i don’t get it but it’s a daily thing, and annoys me.  

he lives in a little shack on his brothers property i believe, or on the couch sometimes but even his brother doesn’t let him have his own space in the house. 

a few years ago he somehow managed to talk my other grandparents into letting him stay there for little to no rent and eat all the food and stink-up the house. 

now i’m looking for ways i can ruin this guys day/week/life. anything helps

things i've tried so far: 
talking to the neighbors about it as nicely as i possibly can.   they just frame it like i'm some crazy person that doesn't like the birds.

after talking with the neighbors didn't work i tried a device that plays predictor bird calls.  the birds just ignore it.  

i have neighbors that have indoor out door cats that roam around the neighborhood, the birds pay no attention to them.  the neighbors also put up fences around the bird feeders to keep cats out and they trap squirrels.   

animal control will do something about barking dogs, but they can't do anything about wildlife that is attracted to the neighborhood.  

the other thing is i have neighbors behind me and to the other side that are very quiet and respectful.  the one behind me only lets their dogs out one by one so they don't bark and bother the neighbors.  i don't want to bother my considerate neighbors too much.",UnethicalLifeProTips

however, i think i'd rather give my mom the car because she's in desperate need. making my plan fall through. unless maybe i can cause my own fake whiplash by stopping hard. however, what reason would an insurance company have to buy that. the first idea has police reports and a wrecked vehicle to speak for itself. i just want some chiropractic work done. when i was younger and got into 3 real wrecks (all of which i wasn't even driving) i never did anything about it.

6976,: how you might be able to surf undetected at work,"find out which program it uses to support remote workers, aka: not within the internal company network.

chances are good the ports used by this program will be open for everyone, no matter if you try to break free from the company network or get within the company network.

let's say you hit the jackpot and it is some commercial solution like teamviewer. now you only have to install that on your home computer, get the portable version at work (runs without admin rights! yay!) and connect to your pc at home, also running teamviewer.

most of the times you can email that portable version just to yourself. if the server filters it, try a password protected zip-file and rename .zip to .pup or something else that's not a valid extension.

you should now be able to connect to your pc at home via an encrypted connection that looks just like another support session.

&amp;#x200b;

this might work with less user friendly remote administration tools like ultra vnc, tight vnc and what have you, but i can not document them all.

&amp;#x200b;

if it finds out, chances are good they are gonna ignore it if you don't start doing other funny business, like transferring your mp3-collection to your work pc or changing anything about your work computer. at least everything you're doing, you're doing to your pc and your internet connection at home, except the traffic of course, so don't count on that too much.

7023,": want to sell your steam account but you're facing tough competition? just report them to steam, and get their account banned.","he most important thing to remember about this is that it's against [steam's subscriber agreement](https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/) to sell your steam account. so if anyone finds a way to prove that you are trying to sell your account, they can simply report you, show proof and steam will ban you quickly.

-

smart sellers will not post any details about their account that could identify them (ex: account name, username, steamid64/32, invite url, account id, etc.), and will simply edit these things out of [steamrep](https://steamrep.com/) and [steamdb](https://steamdb.info/calculator/).

-

another thing to keep in mind is that the linked profiles in the seller's ad may simply be decoy accounts. what happens here is that the user describes their account (games they have, account level, etc...) in the ad's description, but posts a screenshot of a different account (probably not even theirs). in these cases, the seller is probably ""testing the waters"" to see if trying to sell their account at that place will get them banned.

-

in cases like these, and where the seller has blocked all info that could identify them, create a burner account on that website and pretend that you're an interested customer who would like to buy their account, but first needs to see what games are on that account and requires proof that the info in the ad is correct, and that the account is not banned or a decoy by asking them to link their profile (be assertive here, say that someone tried to scam you before and you're ""playing it safe"", force them to use [steamrep](https://steamrep.com/) and [steamdb's calculator](https://steamdb.info/calculator/) and give you a screenshot of the results to prove it's the account they're trying to sell, and pretend that you're ignorant of the fact that steam can ban you if you're trying to sell your account when you ask them for their profile link so they can relax and think you're some idiot from who they can easily gain money from, and who won't report them. it's up to them if they wish to lose a customer and potential revenue over a slight paranoia that they'll get banned, that's why we exploit that).

-

the goal here is to identify their real account to be able to report them, and if you're unable to do that, get as much other information about them as you possibly can (things like; account creation date, profile picture, profile level, total number of games owned, total number of friends they have, ban info (do they have any vac ban or not), etc...) all of it which can be gained from steamrep and steamdb screenshots. you're doing this so you can gather info about them that you will send over to [steam support](https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/helpwithcommunitycontactsupport) (or somewhere else like /r/steam, where some moderators frequently visit) so that steam employees will be able to pinpoint their account with these details (the more you give, the easier it will be for them).

-

**reporting procedure**
-

the reporting procedure is really easy.

before reporting, make sure that you take screenshots of everything as proof of what they're doing. this includes:

- the ad they placed
- chat logs
- the steam account they linked in their ad/chat

instead of taking screenshots, an alternative is to use [archive.is](https://archive.is/) (just paste the link, and press '**save**', wait for the process to finish, and voila!).

horse meat is actually not only delicious, it's very lean and healthy, more so than beef. horses are often eaten in other countries, not so in the united states because they grow slower than cows and are ""companion"" animals. but you don't care!

animals of that size usually dress out to roughly 50% of their weight on the hoof. a 1200 lb horse will yield about 600 pounds of meat. even if you were to grind the whole thing into hamburger, that's the equivalent of $2,400 worth of meat. 

**important: when you initially call the owner, ask if the horse has received any medication recently.** if so, google the medication to find out if you might poison yourself if you eat the horse. 

you will need to be able to dispose of a big-ass skeleton, hide, and pile of guts and sinew. 

you will need to borrow a horse trailer to get the horse, as showing up with a flatbed trailer and a tarp might make the owner suspicious that his horse isn't going to a happy place. you will also need a hammer or gun to kill the horse, and a winch to get his heavy dead horse ass off the ground to start gutting, skinning, and quartering him. you'll need a flat surface, knives, and a shit ton of ziploc bags to contain your horse meat, and a heavy-duty grinder if you want to burger-ize him. if you've never butchered an animal, get help from a fellow unethical who has. you'll need a huge freezer to contain your horse meat.",UnethicalLifeProTips

i'm sure everyone's seen that 'save a business card of someone you don't like for leaving [fraud] contact advice in car accidents'. even if this did work - your goal isn't to get out of a minor accident (else you could just leave **no** note, right?) - clearly the intent is to put your target on the hook for some random harassment. let's step up the game.

swap those business cards out for some stickers. [eggshell vinyl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdfgfzxgyek) is a real game-changer, but hey, you'll probably get the same results just off paper labels from the office supply store.

print some social media links on that shit, and slap it on everything. car windshields, rear vision mirrors, windows...hell, maybe even the front door and letterbox of a few random houses.

sure, your business card tactic may piss off that one guy until he (easily) disproves that it's a false accusation - but with a handful of stickers, you can guarantee that your target is gonna get all manner of angry messages from potentially dozens of people. it literally doesn't matter if they did it or not if it's the only contact details listed.

sure, it won't get you off the hook when you back into a bmw in the carpark - but that business card thing won't either. but if your goal is to get a target harassed by people who are angry at something they didn't do? well...just don't get caught on camera. ;)",UnethicalLifeProTips

7176, request - r6 season 4 gift card return,"here’s some background to this, and i would really appreciate some help. 

i really enjoy playing rainbow six. it was my birthday on monday. well, my brother only had $50, but wanted to get me something. he’s awesome, and spent a good deal of time earning this cash through snow shoveling, household chores, and helping our neighbors. 

he decided he wanted to buy me a season pass for r6. he doesn’t play it, so didn’t understand season 4 was ending. it’s marked for $30usd at target, and he bought it. 

when i unwrapped it, i smiled and thanked him a ton. i knew i’d have to return it, but i really appreciated the thought and considerable amount of money (from his perspective) he put into it. 

today while i was at school, my mom went to return it. now, listen. my mom and i are both extremely introverted. she doesn’t like returning things she legitimately has an issue with. for example, a shirt that was too small, she just wrote it off on herself making a mistake. i knew that going up to the return desk took a great deal of courage for her. i appreciate her a ton. 

the target receipt said non-refundable, but she was hoping we could eventually swap it out for the new season pass, or they’d be understanding. nope. the lady at the desk said that, “you should’ve read the back of the card, and knew the season would be over soon. your fault, not ours.”

generally, i wouldn’t argue with a store. but the problem i have is, **do you really think a 45 year old woman, and 13 year old kid who know nothing about rainbow six would read the fine print on the back?** it’s not about the money. it’s about the principle of it now. 

here’s the information i have: it’s a gift card for season 4 of rainbow six, valued at $30usd. i have the receipt. (it does say “non-refundable” on the receipt.) the gift card was purchased at target. target ‘suggested’ we contact microsoft, who said since we didn’t buy it online, we’d have to talk to ubisoft. (the developer) i’ve sent them an email explaining my situation, but i’m not hopeful.

i live right off a college campus, so granted a lot of my neighbors are students. 

usually this wouldn't be a problem if there weren't so many of them that it makes parking on my street a nightmare. the problem lies in the fact that since they mainly practice cohabitance due to monetary restrictions, my street gets very crowded when school is back. 

if they parked in front of their own houses it wouldn't be a problem, but instead they find parking anywhere they can and i can never park in front of my own house. we dont have driveways in this neighborhood, so that causes some problems.

half the time, i have to park all the way down the street sometimes because people are constantly parking in front of my house, different cars every day.

so.... get a night job. that way five days a week you can sleep in your ""mancave"" for at least 8 hours and relax the rest. then you lock it up and are off to work!

you can have a gym membership for daily showering. note: you can keep a poop bucket (or a composting toilet) and piss bottle for mancave use that you'd empty out. you can dump your trash in dumpsters (plenty of dumpsters everywhere).

7250,: if you are in or going into college get married in order to get a better financial aid package.,"his one works in the usa i'm not sure about the laws elsewhere. to apply for financial aid at american universities you fill out a fafsa. the fafsa uses you and your parents income  to calculate the amount your family can afford to contribute to your tuition. the calculation is bullshit it doesn't take into account siblings,  cost of living, or whether or not your parents actually intend to contribute. regardless the fafsa expects you to include your parents income. however you can avoid including your parents income if you are married, with the landmark supreme court case oberfell vs. hodges it is easier than ever to get married. find a friend who also wants a better aid package, make an appointment at the courthouse, and sign some paperwork. i recommend a solid prenup just incase once of you turns out to be a major dick, you can find solid prenup templates online that you can sign and have notarized while you are at the courthouse. as long as you can avoid banging your new partner until you are out of college you are also eligible for an annulment, which will set your legal standing back to single (this has occasional legal relevance and is the ideal situation) 

for this to work you may need to fill out an additional form with your school which explains why you have a sudden change in family income so that you don't trigger a fraud or accounting issue in your schools financial aid office. also fill out your fafsa as soon as it is available as financial aid is often available on a first come first serve basis, especially pell grants which are going to be your bread and butter with this trick. 

i can confirm that this method works in practice, the brothers in the prelaw fraternity at my school all got married to one another in 2015. they all got basically 50% or better covered off of their tuition. 

make sure you have a reason prepared just in case your financial aid officer asks why you married so young or suddenly, arranged religious marriage is easy and convenient, thus shouldn't be a problem but it doesn't hurt to be prepared.",UnethicalLifeProTips

1 - driver photo doesn’t match driver. you can even take a picture from the backseat and just make sure to only get his back side. uber takes this super seriously and will ban the drivers indefinitely usually within a day. 

2 - make complaint towards drivers car. possibly talk about how the brakes squeak bad or how the driver refused to turn on the air conditioning / heater. 

3 - almost no drivers follow speed limits exactly. just take a video of a straight road and slightly speed it up and say you felt unsafe.

i read some other replies and it was basically the same story, people love chewy because they tell you to donate food and you get a refund. ill try to link some comments later on.

7306, request: how to get my little brother's friends to stop wanting to sleep over.,"okay, so my little brother's friends keep coming over our house to hang out.  i would not have a problem with this, but they take the only room with a tv and they stay over for pretty much the entirety of the time that i would like to use that tv.  i am also going to college and due to my schedule i am spending a lot of time on campus even when i am not taking a class.  apparently they have ""no where else to go"" but i don't buy it.  it's probably just that no one else wants them over their house because they are loud throughout the night (isn't a problem for me).

i don't know what exactly they do down there.  i think i remember them saying that they play dnd, but that clearly isn't what they do for the whole night.  furniture gets moved around and the place is always pretty messy the next morning.  they probably use the tv as well.  not to mention the amount of noise throughout the night.  it is also important to note that i know next to nothing about his friends since they are relatively new.  all i can say for certain is that they are all juniors in high school.

it is also important to note that my parents endorse my brother having his friends over.  they always buy them snacks and order pizza and stuff.  i don't have much of a problem with them coming over once in a while, but they are over too often nowadays and its getting bothersome.  any advice on how to make my house a little less appealing?  i'll answer any questions if that would help.",UnethicalLifeProTips

7309,: what to do in order to avoid paying interest when you're behind on your credit card bi,"first of all a little backstory. i wanted a nintendo switch and some other random stuff for my pc so naturally i did what any other guy in his early 20's would do, i went into debt for them. a few months into my job i got approved for a credit card and the way it works is that if i spend something and put the money back within the same fiscal month i get no interest on it, pretty sweet deal. also there's a list of retailers that have a deal with the credit card company and if you were to purchase from them you could use the bank's app to automatically have the purchase divided into 3 or 6 installments, again, with no interest. that's what i did, paid everything back as scheduled no worries.

now of course, like any other 20 something year old with 0 financial responsibility and a credit card i went overboard one month, spent a little over a thousand dollars on ubering places, ordering out, going for drinks and had no way of putting it back. so of course i was gonna get hit by interest, right? wrong.

what i actually did is go to that local retailer's website, the one i got my switch from, and order another thousand dollars worth of smart tvs. as soon as the purchase was approved and the money went through i used the in-app option to get 6 penalty free installments. i was now roughly 2000 dollars in debt, half of which was gonna get hit with interest when the month passed. i then called the retailer up, said i changed my mind and i no longer wanted the tvs, they cancelled the order and refunded the money to my credit card. the catch? i was still scheduled to pay my debt off in 6 interest-free instalments.

i don't think there's anything illegal here and as long as you have the same deal on your credit card you can probably do the same :\^)",UnethicalLifeProTips

7321, request - please share your anonymous weed buying experience,"&amp;#x200b;

\-&gt; throw away for obvious reasons. 

\-&gt; tl;dr at the end.

hi guys, decided to sell weed anonymously as a side hustle. and i'm really in need of some advice, as well as your experience. 

so a little about me: 

i’m a foreigner that recently moved to a nordic country, and currently reside and work in a small town(4000ppl) 800km away from the capital. i work for a minimum wage, which is ok, but not enough and decided to sell weed as a side hustle. i do not speak the local language, but i'm learning it. i communicate mostly in english, and because of that i'm mostly known as “the foreigner” among the locals, which always puts me under attention :)

the opportunity

due to the distance from the capital and scarcity in general the price of weed here is x2 - x3 times more expensive \~35-45usd per gram. a hefty profit margin, and since there are not that many attractions, people tend to smoke consistently. the market is under-saturated and i think that 150g-300g a month are easy to manage. 

already in touch with an in bulk dealer/grower, that could supply consistently and only requirement is to drive once a month to the capital and back.

the problem

because i’m new to town, language barrier and the locals being nationalistic selling directly would put me in a very bad spot. suspicion and rumors spread here like plague and one wrong sale can put the cops on me very fast. associating with someone is a no-go as with more participants the risk raises, and profit decreases. 

so i came to the conclusion of selling weed anonymously without interacting with the customer. so far i have a few creative solutions, but i'm not really sure if they are the best. so with your help i’m would like to explore your experiences of buying weed anonymously as well as get some feedback from my proposed schemes.

i would greatly appreciate it if you could point out the flaws in my ideas and complete them with a fresh look. 

solutions that might or might not work

1. scavenger method (unsolved cash payment)

hiding the contents in a bunch of locations around the town, in special containers and in different dosages (0.5g, 1g, 2g, and 5g) and geotag them. communicating with potential customers by anon apps such as telegram and sending them the geolink + picture where to find the hidden container. 

the problem is how to receive cash from the buyer in an easy and reliable way?! so that the buyer doesn’t go through an overwhelming process and keeps my anonymity at the same time.  

1. key lock box (unsolved cash payment) [https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/htb10o\_gkqzmbknjszpiq6xfnvxaq.jpg](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/htb10o_gkqzmbknjszpiq6xfnvxaq.jpg)

communication will be through an anon app such as telegram, once a deal is made send the buyer to a specific money drop-off point , after quick confirmation send them to another location where the lock is and send them the code after receiving payment.

the lock will be put in a new random place every time, after getting an order or confirming payment. 

the challenge with this method is the cash drop-off point. how to know that the buyer left the right amount of money in the right place without getting in contact with them. 

how to assure that no one is looking after the drop-off point to identify the person who will take the cash… is there a smart contraption that will assure that?! 

as another payment solution that will keep anonymity and less hassle to go and check for the right amount would be crypto currency. but the issue with crypto is that it is hard tedious process, involving registration, deposit of money to exchange accounts, withdrawal and confirmation time. it is a very elegant solution but it won’t compare with the experience of just giving cash to a dealer. 

please share your experience of buying weed anonymously, and describe in detail how the process of payment(how did the seller get the cash anonymously) and how did you receive the product without compromising yourself. 

and also feel free to criticize and complete the proposed methods.

decided to sell weed anonymously as a side hustle in a nordic country with high profit margins. i need advice on how to do it efficiently without compromising myself, in receiving cash payment, and passing the weed to the buyer in such a way that will rival with the experience of buying weed from a dealer face to face. have proposed 2 methods but are not yet complete. your experience and criticism will help me a lot.

when you lose or destroy your sim you are responsible for that and thus the replacement card will be billed but when you say its malfunctioning suddenly the ball is in the carriers yard. he has to ensure the service you agreed to by contract is provided and the sim card not working is a violation of that. i have yet to hear from a carrier that he demanded you send the broken sim in for analysis. simply not worth it. the card costs below cents propably which is why most tell you to break it and throw it away. 

most carriers use the exact same button to resend a new sim. they just either add the billable charge or send it for free based on your statements.

7336, store going out of business? hide everything you want and come back when the sales and discounts reach their peak," i did this years back at a bonton. tried on a bunch of pants, hid them in the women's section right as the store had everything 10% off. came back weeks later, got a few pair of levi's for 70-80% off.

when toys r us was closing i stashed things in storage above merchandise, hid switch games with the dolls, etc. if i remember correctly i flew too close to the sun with a harry potter wand and it was gone when the store was in their final week.

things to keep in mind:  
\- when a store is closing they're short-staffed and are unlikely to do a lot of re-shelfing so you can hide things for a while. i recommend taking a picture of where you stashed an item so you don't lose it yourself.

\- if a store is to the point that they're closing off portions of the sales floor and selling display units, don't wait much longer. this means merchandise might be moved and sorted.

personally i have a family above me, with two preteen kids who understandably fucking love to run around and jump. i mean reliably 3-4 hours every night, sometimes up to midnight or rarely even later. i talked to the mother about this and offered to exchange numbers so i could directly inform her when i’m home and can hear the kids stomping. she politely told me to fuck off, her kids need to play and she pays for the floor too. i asked why she didn’t get a first floor apartment and she shut the door in my face. good people of /r/unethicallifeprotips, i’m not lying when i say this stomping literally shakes my entire apartment so much that i can feel it through cushioned furniture and my plates and glasses rattle in the cabinets, it makes the apartment uninhabitable and happens every single night. i can’t even have company over because of this. my downstairs neighbor, who i’m friends with, can also hear when the kids above me are going ape shit because they are that crazy and i guess the building is just that cheaply constructed so it travels two floors down. 

fast forward a week and the landlord won’t do anything, i’m having zero peaceful nights at home and they just said the woman denied what i complained about, and also said i was randomly hitting my ceiling (false, it was in response to her kids). 

long story slightly less long, i bought a cheap megaphone [and started blasting the siren feature into my ceiling air vents at full volume](https://i.imgur.com/mrkod8r.jpg) when they’re being unreasonable. if i hear stomping i’ll give them 10 minutes or so to calm down/allow her to be a responsible adult and control her kids, and then just start blasting (for like 5 seconds). pressing it against the vents keeps the sound from traveling around my apartment (and to my other neighbors) and just directs all of it into the ceiling, got the person below me to test it out and it completely overwhelms my entire apartment. so i know they get the message.

this has worked like a miracle for me. it even almost completely put an end to the unreasonable stomping, when it starts up now it will end within a minute or two, because they know what is coming.

quick recap - i posted last week about my boyfriend slowly fading while he went on vacation with his family during the holidays and ultimately blocking me on facebook. during this same time, i was at home burying both of my parents who had just passed within 2 weeks of each other.

i have definitive proof (tinder screenshots, instagram messages, etc) that he was in fact cheating on me. i haven't heard from him in 3 days but i have a feeling he will want his giant ass desktop computer back (that he built primarily for gaming, but it also has solidworks and other software, so i assume it took a lot of time and money to build, and on a broke college kid's budget he won't be making another one in time for his classes to start in 5 days).

i don't want to get into the details of how i found out because i will need this tool in my back pocket for future relationships lmao

but what should i do now with this information?

he comes back to town tomorrow.

here is what i have been thinking

1. message his tinder matches saying ""i have herpes""
2. changing all tinder pics to ones with both of us
3. changing his tinder to show only old men
4. posting to his facebook page ""while my (now ex, because well i'm a sack of shit) girlfriend went home to bury both of her parents over the holidays, i spent the last 3 weeks getting my dick wet. check out my moves \*insert pictures of conversations\*
5. just telling him i'm pregnant to scare the shit out of him
6. completely ghosting/blocking so he literally never gets his stuff back (primarily the computer, but he has his headphones (good ones), hiking shoes and backpack, coffeemaker, swimsuit, and dress pants at my place as well

or any combination of the above!

i'm open to suggestions :)

please don't tell me to grow up or get over it; i have zero intention of getting back with this asshole, i'd just like to end on a glorious note that makes him look and feel like the absolute sack of shit that he is.

thanks for the help.",UnethicalLifeProTips
7415, - get a free duplicate (or your money back) of nearly any item you order on amazon,"he catch here is that multiple items need to be shipped together.  when the package arrives simply call their customer support and report that one of the items (the one you want for free or an extra of) wasn't in the box with the rest of the order.  they will send you a replacement or offer a refund with no information required beyond the last 4 digits of the order number.  i'm not sure if your account will get flagged after doing this often but it works flawlessly for a while at least.

she had an expensive, unopened christmas tree and various christmas decorations. she said she wanted to return the items but then re-purchase them for the discounted rate (75% off). the lady helping her was a manager and didn't bat an eye at the request. 

this got me thinking, instead of waiting until after a holiday to scoop up whatever shitty items are left scattered about, just buy what you want before when they're fully stocked then return after to receive discount. worst case they won't give you the deal and you'll get your $ back.",UnethicalLifeProTips

7513, how to “pass“ a police interrogation,"**1. do not talk about things that the interrogator did not specifically ask you about.**

most of the time guilty suspects will start to ramble on and on about things that aren‘t really connected to the question they were asked. they might do this because they are nervous or because they want to distract.

**2. do not avoid conflict with the interrogator**

the interrogator will insinuate at some point that the police suspects you of committing the crime. they might tell you something like “you and [victim] weren’t on good terms, right?“ guilty suspects will ignore this indirect accusation and start to downplay everything. an innocent suspect however will not ignore it and say something like “yes, me and [victim‘s name] didn‘t like each other much but i didn‘t hurt/kill/kidnap  her/him. are you trying to say it was me ?“

**3. do not remove yourself from the situation**

guilty suspects will unconsciously remove/detach themselves from the crime situation. a father who murdered his children for example will say “these kids/the kids“ instead of “my kids“.

**4. be as honest as possible**

even if you have committed the crime, try to be as honest as possible about the surrounding situation. do not invent places/people or lie about dates/times when it is not *extremely* necessary. otherwise this will lead to more questions which will lead to more lies.

**5. in the us the police is allowed to lie to you.**

in order to get a confession the interrogator might tell you that they have clear proof of your involvement in a crime, when in reality they only have some evidence. for example “we have an hd – surveillance photo of you at the crime scene“ when in reality it‘s just a blurry picture that wouldn’t be enough to incriminate you. 
in the uk this interrogation method is illegal but not in the us.

**6. get a lawyer &amp; talk as little as possible**

a lawyer will most likely tell you not to say anything and to leave the interrogation if you can. that is why the interrogator(s) will try to distract you from calling a lawyer by acting ignorant, patient and non–threatening. 
this way most suspects won‘t feel the need to call a lawyer or leave the interrogation.

**7. do not commit the crime**

7522,: you can price match at most major stores. look up the same item on a competitor's webpage and use javascript to alter the price.,"it's a pretty simple way to price match and easily get about $50 or 50% off depending on the price of the item. 

1. just go to a big name store and find the item you want to buy.

2. look the item up on your phone at a different store. 

3. use javascript and paste it into the url of the webpage. this lets you type in a different price to them match against 

javascript:document.body.contenteditable = 'true'; document.designmode='on'; void 0

(note, on most browsers you have to type 'javascript:' as it won't paste in the url)

4. ask an employee if they will price match and show the altered discounted price you set.

tips: don't go more than $50 or 50% of the items base price to avoid attention. don't use this too often at the same store. save this for big ticket items that cost hundreds to save more money.",UnethicalLifeProTips
